                Between our eastward and our westward sea
                The narrowing strand
                Clasps close the noblest shore fame holds in fee
                Even here where English birth seals all men free—
                Northumberland.
            
            
                The sea-mists meet across it when the snow
                Clothes moor and fell,
                And bid their true-born hearts who love it glow
                For joy that none less nobly born may know
                What love knows well.
            
            
                The splendour and the strength of storm and fight
                Sustain the song
                That filled our fathers' hearts with joy to smite,
                To live, to love, to lay down life that right
                Might tread down wrong.
            
            
                They warred, they sang, they triumphed, and they passed,
                And left us glad
                Here to be born, their sons, whose hearts hold fast
                The proud old love no change can overcast,
                No chance leave sad.
            
            
            
                None save our northmen ever, none but we,
                Met, pledged, or fought
                Such foes and friends as Scotland and the sea
                With heart so high and equal, strong in glee
                And stern in thought.
            
            
                Thought, fed from time's memorial springs with pride,
                Made strong as fire
                Their hearts who hurled the foe down Flodden side,
                And hers who rode the waves none else durst ride—
                None save her sire.
            
            
                O land beloved, where nought of legend's dream
                Outshines the truth,
                Where Joyous Gard, closed round with clouds that gleam
                For them that know thee not, can scarce but seem
                Too sweet for sooth,
            
            
                Thy sons forget not, nor shall fame forget,
                The deed there done
                Before the walls whose fabled fame is yet
                A light too sweet and strong to rise and set
                With moon and sun.
            
            
                Song bright as flash of swords or oars that shine
                Through fight or foam
                Stirs yet the blood thou hast given thy sons like wine
                To hail in each bright ballad hailed as thine
                One heart, one home.
            
            
            
                Our Collingwood, though Nelson be not ours,
                By him shall stand
                Immortal, till those waifs of oldworld hours,
                Forgotten, leave uncrowned with bays and flowers
                Northumberland.
