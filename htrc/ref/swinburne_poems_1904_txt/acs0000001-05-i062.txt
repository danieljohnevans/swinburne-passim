                				My brother, my Valerius, dearest head
                				Of all whose crowning bay-leaves crown their mother
                				Rome, in the notes first heard of thine I read
                				My brother.
                			
                			
                				No dust that death or time can strew may smother
                				Love and the sense of kinship inly bred
                				From loves and hates at one with one another.
                			
                			
                				To thee was CÃ¦sar's self nor dear nor dread,
                				Song and the sea were sweeter each than other:
                				How should I living fear to call thee dead,
                				My brother?
