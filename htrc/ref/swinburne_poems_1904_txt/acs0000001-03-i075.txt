                    I
                
                
                    From the Italian of Giovanni Strozzi
                
                
                Night, whom in shape so sweet thou here may'st see
                Sleeping, was by an Angel sculptured thus
                In marble, and since she sleeps hath life like us:
                Thou doubt'st? Awake her: she will speak to thee.
                
            
            
                
                    II
                
                
                    From the Italian of Michelangelo Buonarroti
                
                
                Sleep likes me well, and better yet to know
                I am but stone. While shame and grief must be,
                Good hap is mine, to feel not, nor to see:
                Take heed, then, lest thou wake me: ah, speak low.
