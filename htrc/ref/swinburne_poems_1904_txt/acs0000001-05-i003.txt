				When the might of the summer
				Is most on the sea;
				When the days overcome her
				With joy but to be,
				With rapture of royal enchantment, and sorcery that sets her not free,
			
			
				But for hours upon hours
				As a thrall she remains
				Spell-bound as with flowers
				And content in their chains,
				And her loud steeds fret not, and lift not a lock of their deep white manes;
			
			
				Then only, far under
				In the depths of her hold,
				Some gleam of its wonder
				Man's eye may behold,
				Its wild-weed forests of crimson and russet and olive and gold.
			
			
				Still deeper and dimmer
				And goodlier they glow
				For the eyes of the swimmer
				Who scans them below
				As he crosses the zone of their flowerage that knows not of sunshine and snow.
			
			
			
				Soft blossomless frondage
				And foliage that gleams
				As to prisoners in bondage
				The light of their dreams,
				The desire of a dawn unbeholden, with hope on the wings of its beams.
			
			
				Not as prisoners entombed
				Waxen haggard and wizen,
				But consoled and illumed
				In the depths of their prison
				With delight of the light everlasting and vision of dawn on them risen,
			
			
				From the banks and the beds
				Of the waters divine
				They lift up their heads
				And the flowers of them shine
				Through the splendour of darkness that clothes them of water that glimmers like wine.
			
			
				Bright bank over bank
				Making glorious the gloom,
				Soft rank upon rank,
				Strange bloom after bloom,
				They kindle the liquid low twilight, the dusk of the dim sea's womb.
			
			
				Through the subtle and tangible
				Gloom without form,
				Their branches, infrangible
				Ever of storm,
				Spread softer their sprays than the shoots of the woodland when April is warm.
			
			
			
				As the flight of the thunder, full
				Charged with its word,
				Dividing the wonderful
				Depths like a bird,
				Speaks wrath and delight to the heart of the night that exults to have heard,
			
			
				So swiftly, though soundless
				In silence's ear,
				Light, winged from the boundless
				Blue depths full of cheer,
				Speaks joy to the heart of the waters that part not before him, but hear.
			
			
				Light, perfect and visible
				Godhead of God,
				God indivisible,
				Lifts but his rod,
				And the shadows are scattered in sunder, and darkness is light at his nod.
			
			
				At the touch of his wand,
				At the nod of his head
				From the spaces beyond
				Where the dawn hath her bed,
				Earth, water, and air are transfigured, and rise as one risen from the dead.
			
			
				He puts forth his hand,
				And the mountains are thrilled
				To the heart as they stand
				In his presence, fulfilled
				With his glory that utters his grace upon earth, and her sorrows are stilled.
			
			
			
				The moan of her travail
				That groans for the light
				Till dayspring unravel
				The weft of the night,
				At the sound of the strings of the music of morning, falls dumb with delight.
			
			
				He gives forth his word,
				And the word that he saith,
				Ere well it be heard,
				Strikes darkness to death;
				For the thought of his heart is the sunrise, and dawn as the sound of his breath.
			
			
				And the strength of its pulses
				That passion makes proud
				Confounds and convulses
				The depths of the cloud
				Of the darkness that heaven was engirt with, divided and rent as a shroud,
			
			
				As the veil of the shrine
				Of the temple of old
				When darkness divine
				Over noonday was rolled;
				So the heart of the night by the pulse of the light is convulsed and controlled.
			
			
				And the sea's heart, groaning
				For glories withdrawn,
				And the waves' mouths, moaning
				All night for the dawn,
				Are uplift as the hearts and the mouths of the singers on leaside and lawn.
			
			
			
				And the sound of the quiring
				Of all these as one,
				Desired and desiring
				Till dawn's will be done,
				Fills full with delight of them heaven till it burns as the heart of the sun.
			
			
				Till the waves too inherit
				And waters take part
				In the sense of the spirit
				That breathes from his heart,
				And are kindled with music as fire when the lips of the morning part,
			
			
				With music unheard
				In the light of her lips,
				In the life-giving word
				Of the dewfall that drips
				On the grasses of earth, and the wind that enkindles the wings of the ships.
			
			
				White glories of wings
				As of seafaring birds
				That flock from the springs
				Of the sunrise in herds
				With the wind for a herdsman, and hasten or halt at the change of his words.
			
			
				At the watchword's change
				When the wind's note shifts,
				And the skies grow strange,
				And the white squall drifts
				Up sharp from the sea-line, vexing the sea till the low cloud lifts.
			
			
			
				At the charge of his word
				Bidding pause, bidding haste,
				When the ranks are stirred
				And the lines displaced,
				They scatter as wild swans parting adrift on the wan green waste.
			
			
				At the hush of his word
				In a pause of his breath
				When the waters have heard
				His will that he saith,
				They stand as a flock penned close in its fold for division of death.
			
			
				As a flock by division
				Of death to be thinned,
				As the shades in a vision
				Of spirits that sinned;
				So glimmer their shrouds and their sheetings as clouds on the stream of the wind.
			
			
				But the sun stands fast,
				And the sea burns bright,
				And the flight of them past
				Is no more than the flight
				Of the snow-soft swarm of serene wings poised and afloat in the light.
			
			
				Like flowers upon flowers
				In a festival way
				When hours after hours
				Shed grace on the day,
				White blossomlike butterflies hover and gleam through the snows of the spray.
			
			
			
				Like snow-coloured petals
				Of blossoms that flee
				From storm that unsettles
				The flower as the tree
				They flutter, a legion of flowers on the wing, through the field of the sea.
			
			
				Through the furrowless field
				Where the foam-blossoms blow
				And the secrets are sealed
				Of their harvest below
				They float in the path of the sunbeams, as flakes or as blossoms of snow.
			
			
				Till the sea's ways darken,
				And the God, withdrawn,
				Give ear not or hearken
				If prayer on him fawn,
				And the sun's self seem but a shadow, the noon as a ghost of the dawn.
			
			
				No shadow, but rather
				God, father of song,
				Show grace to me, Father
				God, loved of me long,
				That I lose not the light of thy face, that my trust in thee work me not wrong.
			
			
				While yet I make forward
				With face toward thee
				Not turned yet in shoreward,
				Be thine upon me;
				Be thy light on my forehead or ever I turn it again from the sea.
			
			
			
				As a kiss on my brow
				Be the light of thy grace,
				Be thy glance on me now
				From the pride of thy place:
				As the sign of a sire to a son be the light on my face of thy face.
			
			
				Thou wast father of olden
				Times hailed and adored,
				And the sense of thy golden
				Great harp's monochord
				Was the joy in the soul of the singers that hailed thee for master and lord.
			
			
				Fair father of all
				In thy ways that have trod,
				That have risen at thy call,
				That have thrilled at thy nod,
				Arise, shine, lighten upon me, O sun that we see to be God.
			
			
				As my soul has been dutiful
				Only to thee,
				O God most beautiful,
				Lighten thou me,
				As I swim through the dim long rollers, with eyelids uplift from the sea.
			
			
				Be praised and adored of us
				All in accord,
				Father and lord of us
				Alway adored,
				The slayer and the stayer and the harper, the light of us all and our lord.
			
			
			
				At the sound of thy lyre,
				At the touch of thy rod,
				Air quickens to fire
				By the foot of thee trod,
				The saviour and healer and singer, the living and visible God.
			
			
				The years are before thee
				As shadows of thee,
				As men that adore thee,
				As cloudlets that flee:
				But thou art the God, and thy kingdom is heaven, and thy shrine is the sea.
