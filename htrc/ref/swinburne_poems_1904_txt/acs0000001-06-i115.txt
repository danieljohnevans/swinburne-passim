                Three weeks since there was no such rose in being;
                Now may eyes made dim with deep delight
                See how fair it is, laugh with love, and seeing
                Praise the chance that bids us bless the sight.
            
            
                Three weeks old, and a very rose of roses,
                Bright and sweet as love is sweet and bright.
                Heaven and earth, till a man's life wanes and closes,
                Show not life or love a lovelier sight.
            
            
                Three weeks past have renewed the rosebright creature
                Day by day with life, and night by night.
                Love, though fain of its every faultless feature,
                Finds not words to match the silent sight.
