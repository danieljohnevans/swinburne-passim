    					πὺξ ἀπετὰν εὑρών.—Pindar.
    				
    				
    					
    					Praise of the knights of old
    					
    					May sleep: their tale is told,
    					And no man cares:
    					The praise which fires our lips is
    					A knight's whose fame eclipses
    					All of theirs.
    				
    				
    					The ruddiest light in heaven
    					Blazed as his birth-star seven
    					Long years ago:
    					All glory crown that old year
    					Which brought our stout small soldier
    					With the snow!
    				
    				
    					Each baby born has one
    					Star, for his friends a sun,
    					The first of stars:
    					And we, the more we scan it,
    					The more grow sure your planet,
    					Child, was Mars.
    				
    				
    					For each one flower, perchance,
    					Blooms as his cognizance:
    					The snowdrop chill,
    					
    					The violet unbeholden,
    					For some: for you the golden
    					Daffodil.
    				
    				
    					Erect, a fighting flower,
    					It breasts the breeziest hour
    					That ever blew,
    					And bent or broke things brittle
    					Or frail, unlike a little
    					Knight like you.
    				
    				
    					Its flower is firm and fresh
    					And stout like sturdiest flesh
    					Of children: all
    					The strenuous blast that parches
    					Spring hurts it not till March is
    					Near his fall.
    				
    				
    					If winds that prate and fret
    					Remark, rebuke, regret,
    					Lament, or blame
    					The brave plant's martial passion,
    					It keeps its own free fashion
    					All the same.
    				
    				
    					We that would fain seem wise
    					Assume grave mouths and eyes
    					Whose looks reprove
    					Too much delight in battle:
    					But your great heart our prattle
    					Cannot move.
    				
    				
    					We say, small children should
    					Be placid, mildly good
    					And blandly meek:
    					
    					Whereat the broad smile rushes
    					Full on your lips, and flushes
    					All your cheek.
    				
    				
    					If all the stars that are
    					Laughed out, and every star
    					Could here be heard,
    					Such peals of golden laughter
    					We should not hear, as after
    					Such a word.
    				
    				
    					For all the storm saith, still,
    					Stout stands the daffodil:
    					For all we say,
    					Howe'er he look demurely,
    					Our martialist will surely
    					Have his way.
    				
    				
    					We may not bind with bands
    					Those large and liberal hands,
    					Nor stay from fight,
    					Nor hold them back from giving:
    					No lean mean laws of living
    					Bind a knight.
    				
    				
    					And always here of old
    					Such gentle hearts and bold
    					Our land has bred:
    					How durst her eye rest else on
    					The glory shed from Nelson
    					Quick and dead?
    				
    				
    					Shame were it, if but one
    					Such once were born her son,
    					That one to have borne,
    					
    					And brought him ne'er a brother:
    					His praise should bring his mother
    					Shame and scorn.
    				
    				
    					A child high-souled as he
    					Whose manhood shook the sea
    					Smiles haply here:
    					His face, where love lies basking,
    					With bright shut mouth seems asking,
    					What is fear?
    				
    				
    					The sunshine-coloured fists
    					Beyond his dimpling wrists
    					Were never closed
    					For saving or for sparing—
    					For only deeds of daring
    					Predisposed.
    				
    				
    					Unclenched, the gracious hands
    					Let slip their gifts like sands
    					Made rich with ore
    					That tongues of beggars ravish
    					From small stout hands so lavish
    					Of their store.
    				
    				
    					Sweet hardy kindly hands
    					Like these were his that stands
    					With heel on gorge
    					Seen trampling down the dragon
    					On sign or flask or flagon,
    					Sweet Saint George.
    				
    				
    					Some tournament, perchance,
    					Of hands that couch no lance,
    					Might mark this spot
    					
    					Your lists, if here some pleasant
    					Small Guenevere were present,
    					Launcelot.
    				
    				
    					My brave bright flower, you need
    					No foolish song, nor heed
    					It more than spring
    					The sighs of winter stricken
    					Dead when your haunts requicken
    					Here, my king.
    				
    				
    					Yet O, how hardly may
    					The wheels of singing stay
    					That whirl along
    					Bright paths whence echo raises
    					The phantom of your praises,
    					Child, my song!
    				
    				
    					Beyond all other things
    					That give my words fleet wings,
    					Fleet wings and strong,
    					You set their jesses ringing
    					Till hardly can I, singing,
    					Stint my song.
    				
    				
    					But all things better, friend,
    					And worse must find an end:
    					And, right or wrong,
    					'Tis time, lest rhyme should baffle,
    					I doubt, to put a snaffle
    					On my song.
    				
    				
    					And never may your ear
    					Aught harsher hear or fear,
    					Nor wolfish night
    					
    					Nor dog-toothed winter snarling
    					Behind your steps, my darling
    					My delight!
    				
    				
    					For all the gifts you give
    					Me, dear, each day you live,
    					Of thanks above
    					All thanks that could be spoken
    					Take not my song in token,
    					Take my love.
