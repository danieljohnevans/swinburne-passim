            A Lyrical Idyl
            
                
                        Thalassius
                    

                Pan!

            
            
                
                        Pan
                    
                
                    O sea-stray, seed of Apollo,
                    What word wouldst thou have with me?
                    My ways thou wast fain to follow
                    Or ever the years hailed thee
                    Man.
                
                
                    Now
                    If August brood on the valleys,
                    If satyrs laugh on the lawns,
                    What part in the wildwood alleys
                    Hast thou with the fleet-foot fauns—
                    Thou?
                
                
                    See!
                    Thy feet are a man's—not cloven
                    Like these, not light as a boy's:
                    The tresses and tendrils inwoven
                    That lure us, the lure of them cloys
                    Thee.
                
                
                
                    Us
                    The joy of the wild woods never
                    Leaves free of the thirst it slakes:
                    The wild love throbs in us ever
                    That burns in the dense hot brakes
                    Thus.
                
                
                    Life,
                    Eternal, passionate, awless,
                    Insatiable, mutable, dear,
                    Makes all men's law for us lawless:
                    We strive not: how should we fear
                    Strife?
                
                
                    We,
                    The birds and the bright winds know not
                    Such joys as are ours in the mild
                    Warm woodland; joys such as grow not
                    In waste green fields of the wild
                    Sea.
                
                
                    No;
                    Long since, in the world's wind veering,
                    Thy heart was estranged from me:
                    Sweet Echo shall yield thee not hearing:
                    What have we to do with thee?
                    Go.
                
            
            
                
                        Thalassius
                    
                
                    Ay!
                    Such wrath on thy nostril quivers
                    As once in Sicilian heat
                    Bade herdsmen quail, and the rivers
                    Shrank, leaving a path for thy feet
                    Dry?
                
                
                
                    Nay,
                    Low down in the hot soft hollow
                    Too snakelike hisses thy spleen:
                    O sea-stray, seed of Apollo!
                    What ill hast thou heard or seen?
                    Say.
                
                
                    Man
                    Knows well, if he hears beside him
                    The snarl of thy wrath at noon,
                    What evil may soon betide him,
                    Or late, if thou smite not soon,
                    Pan.
                
                
                    Me
                    The sound of thy flute, that flatters
                    The woods as they smile and sigh,
                    Charmed fast as it charms thy satyrs,
                    Can charm no faster than I
                    Thee.
                
                
                    Fast
                    Thy music may charm the splendid
                    Wide woodland silence to sleep
                    With sounds and dreams of thee blended
                    And whispers of waters that creep
                    Past.
                
                
                    Here
                    The spell of thee breathes and passes
                    And bids the heart in me pause,
                    Hushed soft as the leaves and the grasses
                    Are hushed if the storm's foot draws
                    Near.
                
                
                
                    Yet
                    The panic that strikes down strangers
                    Transgressing thy ways unaware
                    Affrights not me nor endangers
                    Through dread of thy secret snare
                    Set.
                
            
            
                
                        Pan
                    
                
                    Whence
                    May man find heart to deride me?
                    Who made his face as a star
                    To shine as a God's beside me?
                    Nay, get thee away from us, far
                    Hence.
                
            
            
                
                        Thalassius
                    
                
                    Then
                    Shall no man's heart, as he raises
                    A hymn to thy secret head,
                    Wax great with the godhead he praises:
                    Thou, God, shalt be like unto dead
                    Men.
                
            
            
                
                        Pan
                    
                
                    Grace
                    I take not of men's thanksgiving,
                    I crave not of lips that live;
                    They die, and behold, I am living,
                    While they and their dead Gods give
                    Place.
                
            
            
            
                
                        Thalassius
                    
                
                    Yea:
                    Too lightly the words were spoken
                    That mourned or mocked at thee dead:
                    But whose was the word, the token,
                    The song that answered and said
                    Nay?
                
            
            
                
                        Pan
                    
                
                    Whose
                    But mine, in the midnight hidden,
                    Clothed round with the strength of night
                    And mysteries of things forbidden
                    For all but the one most bright
                    Muse?
                
            
            
                
                        Thalassius
                    
                
                    Hers
                    Or thine, O Pan, was the token
                    That gave back empire to thee
                    When power in thy hands lay broken
                    As reeds that quake if a bee
                    Stirs?
                
            
            
                
                        Pan
                    
                
                    Whom
                    Have I in my wide woods need of?
                    Urania's limitless eyes
                    Behold not mine end, though they read of
                    A word that shall speak to the skies
                    Doom.
                
            
            
            
                
                        Thalassius
                    
                
                    She
                    Gave back to thee kingdom and glory,
                    And grace that was thine of yore,
                    And life to thy leaves, late hoary
                    As weeds cast up from the hoar
                    Sea.
                
                
                    Song
                    Can bid faith shine as the morning
                    Though light in the world be none:
                    Death shrinks if her tongue sound warning,
                    Night quails, and beholds the sun
                    Strong.
                
            
            
                
                        Pan
                    
                
                    Night
                    Bare rule over men for ages
                    Whose worship wist not of me
                    And gat but sorrows for wages,
                    And hardly for tears could see
                    Light.
                
                
                    Call
                    No more on the starry presence
                    Whose light through the long dark swam:
                    Hold fast to the green world's pleasance:
                    For I that am lord of it am
                    All.
                
            
            
            
                
                        Thalassius
                    
                
                    God,
                    God Pan, from the glad wood's portal
                    The breaths of thy song blow sweet:
                    But woods may be walked in of mortal
                    Man's thought, where never thy feet
                    Trod.
                
                
                    Thine
                    All secrets of growth and of birth are,
                    All glories of flower and of tree,
                    Wheresoever the wonders of earth are;
                    The words of the spell of the sea
                    Mine.
