                Wind-weary; while with lifting head he waits
                For breath to reinspire him from the gates
                That open still toward sunrise on the vault
                High-domed of morning, and in flight's default
                With spreading sense of spirit anticipates
                What new sea now may lure beyond the straits
                His wings exulting that her winds exalt
                And fill them full as sails to seaward spread,
                Fulfilled with fair speed's promise. Pass, my song,
                Forth to the haven of thy desire and dread,
                The presence of our lord, long loved and long
                Far off above beholden, who to thee
                Was as light kindling all a windy sea.
