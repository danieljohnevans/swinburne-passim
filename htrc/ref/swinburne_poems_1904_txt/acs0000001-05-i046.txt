                				Far-fetched and dear-bought, as the proverb rehearses,
                				Is good, or was held so, for ladies: but nought
                				In a song can be good if the turn of the verse is
                				Far-fetched and dear-bought.
                			
                			
                				As the turn of a wave should it sound, and the thought
                				Ring smooth, and as light as the spray that disperses
                				Be the gleam of the words for the garb thereof wrought.
                			
                			
                				Let the soul in it shine through the sound as it pierces
                				Men's hearts with possession of music unsought;
                				For the bounties of song are no jealous god's mercies,
                				Far-fetched and dear-bought.
