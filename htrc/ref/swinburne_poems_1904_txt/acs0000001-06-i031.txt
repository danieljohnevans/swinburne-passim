		Summer , and noon, and a splendour of silence, felt,
	
	Seen, and heard of the spirit within the sense.
	Soft through the frondage the shades of the sunbeams melt,
	Sharp through the foliage the shafts of them, keen and dense,
	Cleave, as discharged from the string of the God's bow, tense
	As a war-steed's girth, and bright as a warrior's belt.
	Ah, why should an hour that is heaven for an hour pass hence?


	I dare not sleep for delight of the perfect hour,
	Lest God be wroth that his gift should be scorned of man.
	The face of the warm bright world is the face of a flower,
	The word of the wind and the leaves that the light winds fan
	As the word that quickened at first into flame, and ran,
	Creative and subtle and fierce with invasive power,
	Through darkness and cloud, from the breath of the one God, Pan.



	The perfume of earth possessed by the sun pervades
	The chaster air that he soothes but with sense of sleep.
	Soft, imminent, strong as desire that prevails and fades,
	The passing noon that beholds not a cloudlet weep
	Imbues and impregnates life with delight more deep
	Than dawn or sunset or moonrise on lawns or glades
	Can shed from the skies that receive it and may not keep.


	The skies may hold not the splendour of sundown fast;
	It wanes into twilight as dawn dies down into day.
	And the moon, triumphant when twilight is overpast,
	Takes pride but awhile in the hours of her stately sway.
	But the might of the noon, though the light of it pass away,
	Leaves earth fulfilled of desires and of dreams that last;
	But if any there be that hath sense of them none can say.


	For if any there be that hath sight of them, sense, or trust
	Made strong by the might of a vision, the strength of a dream,
	His lips shall straiten and close as a dead man's must,
	His heart shall be sealed as the voice of a frost-bound stream.
    
	For the deep mid mystery of light and of heat that seem
	To clasp and pierce dark earth, and enkindle dust,
	Shall a man's faith say what it is? or a man's guess deem?


	Sleep lies not heavier on eyes that have watched all night
	Than hangs the heat of the noon on the hills and trees.
	Why now should the haze not open, and yield to sight
	A fairer secret than hope or than slumber sees?
	I seek not heaven with submission of lips and knees,
	With worship and prayer for a sign till it leap to light:
	I gaze on the gods about me, and call on these.


	I call on the gods hard by, the divine dim powers
	Whose likeness is here at hand, in the breathless air,
	In the pulseless peace of the fervid and silent flowers,
	In the faint sweet speech of the waters that whisper there.
	Ah, what should darkness do in a world so fair?
	The bent-grass heaves not, the couch-grass quails not or cowers;
	The wind's kiss frets not the rowan's or aspen's hair.


	But the silence trembles with passion of sound suppressed,
	And the twilight quivers and yearns to the sunward, wrung
    
	With love as with pain; and the wide wood's motionless breast
	Is thrilled with a dumb desire that would fain find tongue
	And palpitates, tongueless as she whom a man-snake stung,
	Whose heart now heaves in the nightingale, never at rest
	Nor satiated ever with song till her last be sung.


	Is it rapture or terror that circles me round, and invades
	Each vein of my life with hope—if it be not fear?
	Each pulse that awakens my blood into rapture fades,
	Each pulse that subsides into dread of a strange thing near
	Requickens with sense of a terror less dread than dear.
	Is peace not one with light in the deep green glades
	Where summer at noonday slumbers? Is peace not here?


	The tall thin stems of the firs, and the roof sublime
	That screens from the sun the floor of the steep still wood,
	Deep, silent, splendid, and perfect and calm as time,
	Stand fast as ever in sight of the night they stood,
	When night gave all that moonlight and dewfall could.
	The dense ferns deepen, the moss glows warm as the thyme:
	The wild heath quivers about me: the world is good.



	Is it Pan's breath, fierce in the tremulous maidenhair,
	That bids fear creep as a snake through the woodlands, felt
	In the leaves that it stirs not yet, in the mute bright air,
	In the stress of the sun? For here has the great God dwelt:
	For hence were the shafts of his love or his anger dealt.
	For here has his wrath been fierce as his love was fair,
	When each was as fire to the darkness its breath bade melt.


	Is it love, is it dread, that enkindles the trembling noon,
	That yearns, reluctant in rapture that fear has fed,
	As man for woman, as woman for man? Full soon,
	If I live, and the life that may look on him drop not dead,
	Shall the ear that hears not a leaf quake hear his tread,
	The sense that knows not the sound of the deep day's tune
	Receive the God, be it love that he brings or dread.


	The naked noon is upon me: the fierce dumb spell,
	The fearful charm of the strong sun's imminent might,
	Unmerciful, steadfast, deeper than seas that swell,
	Pervades, invades, appals me with loveless light,
	With harsher awe than breathes in the breath of night.
	Have mercy, God who art all! For I know thee well,
	How sharp is thine eye to lighten, thine hand to smite.



	The whole wood feels thee, the whole air fears thee: but fear
	So deep, so dim, so sacred, is wellnigh sweet.
	For the light that hangs and broods on the woodlands here,
	Intense, invasive, intolerant, imperious, and meet
	To lighten the works of thine hands and the ways of thy feet,
	Is hot with the fire of the breath of thy life, and dear
	As hope that shrivels or shrinks not for frost or heat.


	Thee, thee the supreme dim godhead, approved afar,
	Perceived of the soul and conceived of the sense of man,
	We scarce dare love, and we dare not fear: the star
	We call the sun, that lit us when life began
	To brood on the world that is thine by his grace for a span,
	Conceals and reveals in the semblance of things that are
	Thine immanent presence, the pulse of thy heart's life, Pan.


	The fierce mid noon that wakens and warms the snake
	Conceals thy mercy, reveals thy wrath: and again
	The dew-bright hour that assuages the twilight brake
	Conceals thy wrath and reveals thy mercy: then
	Thou art fearful only for evil souls of men
	That feel with nightfall the serpent within them wake,
	And hate the holy darkness on glade and glen.



	Yea, then we know not and dream not if ill things be,
	Or if aught of the work of the wrong of the world be thine.
	We hear not the footfall of terror that treads the sea,
	We hear not the moan of winds that assail the pine:
	We see not if shipwreck reign in the storm's dim shrine;
	If death do service and doom bear witness to thee
	We see not,—know not if blood for thy lips be wine.


	But in all things evil and fearful that fear may scan,
	As in all things good, as in all things fair that fall,
	We know thee present and latent, the lord of man;
	In the murmuring of doves, in the clamouring of winds that call
	And wolves that howl for their prey; in the midnight's pall,
	In the naked and nymph-like feet of the dawn, O Pan,
	And in each life living, O thou the God who art all.


	Smiling and singing, wailing and wringing of hands,
	Laughing and weeping, watching and sleeping, still
	Proclaim but and prove but thee, as the shifted sands
	Speak forth and show but the strength of the sea's wild will
	That sifts and grinds them as grain in the stormwind's mill.
	In thee is the doom that falls and the doom that stands:
	The tempests utter thy word, and the stars fulfil.



	Where Etna shudders with passion and pain volcanic
	That rend her heart as with anguish that rends a man's,
	Where Typho labours, and finds not his thews Titanic,
	In breathless torment that ever the flame's breath fans,
	Men felt and feared thee of old, whose pastoral clans
	Were given to the charge of thy keeping; and soundless panic
	Held fast the woodland whose depths and whose heights were Pan's.


	And here, though fear be less than delight, and awe
	Be one with desire and with worship of earth and thee,
	So mild seems now thy secret and speechless law,
	So fair and fearless and faithful and godlike she,
	So soft the spell of thy whisper on stream and sea,
	Yet man should fear lest he see what of old men saw
	And withered: yet shall I quail if thy breath smite me.


	Lord God of life and of light and of all things fair,
	Lord God of ravin and ruin and all things dim,
	Death seals up life, and darkness the sunbright air,
	And the stars that watch blind earth in the deep night swim
    Laugh, saying, What God is your God, that ye call on him?
    What is man, that the God who is guide of our way should care
    If day for a man be golden, or night be grim?



	But thou, dost thou hear? Stars too but abide for a span,
	Gods too but endure for a season; but thou, if thou be
	God, more than shadows conceived and adored of man,
	Kind Gods and fierce, that bound him or made him free,
	The skies that scorn us are less in thy sight than we,
	Whose souls have strength to conceive and perceive thee, Pan,
	With sense more subtle than senses that hear and see.


	Yet may not it say, though it seek thee and think to find
	One soul of sense in the fire and the frost-bound clod,
	What heart is this, what spirit alive or blind,
	That moves thee: only we know that the ways we trod
	We tread, with hands unguided, with feet unshod,
	With eyes unlightened; and yet, if with steadfast mind,
	Perchance may we find thee and know thee at last for God.


	Yet then should God be dark as the dawn is bright,
	And bright as the night is dark on the world—no more.
	Light slays not darkness, and darkness absorbs not light;
	And the labour of evil and good from the years of yore
    
	Is even as the labour of waves on a sunless shore.
	And he who is first and last, who is depth and height,
	Keeps silence now, as the sun when the woods wax hoar.


	The dark dumb godhead innate in the fair world's life
	Imbues the rapture of dawn and of noon with dread,
	Infects the peace of the star-shod night with strife,
	Informs with terror the sorrow that guards the dead.
	No service of bended knee or of humbled head
	May soothe or subdue the God who has change to wife:
	And life with death is as morning with evening wed.


	And yet, if the light and the life in the light that here
	Seem soft and splendid and fervid as sleep may seem
	Be more than the shine of a smile or the flash of a tear,
	Sleep, change, and death are less than a spell-struck dream,
	And fear than the fall of a leaf on a starlit stream.
	And yet, if the hope that hath said it absorb not fear,
	What helps it man that the stars and the waters gleam?


	What helps it man, that the noon be indeed intense,
	The night be indeed worth worship? Fear and pain
	Were lords and masters yet of the secret sense,
	Which now dares deem not that light is as darkness, fain
	Though dark dreams be to declare it, crying in vain.
    
	For whence, thou God of the light and the darkness, whence
	Dawns now this vision that bids not the sunbeams wane?


	What light, what shadow, diviner than dawn or night,
	Draws near, makes pause, and again—or I dream—draws near?
	More soft than shadow, more strong than the strong sun's light,
	More pure than moonbeams—yea, but the rays run sheer
	As fire from the sun through the dusk of the pinewood, clear
	And constant; yea, but the shadow itself is bright
	That the light clothes round with love that is one with fear.


	Above and behind it the noon and the woodland lie,
	Terrible, radiant with mystery, superb and subdued,
	Triumphant in silence; and hardly the sacred sky
	Seems free from the tyrannous weight of the dumb fierce mood
	Which rules as with fire and invasion of beams that brood
	The breathless rapture of earth till its hour pass by
	And leave her spirit released and her peace renewed.


	I sleep not: never in sleep has a man beholden
	This. From the shadow that trembles and yearns with light
	Suppressed and elate and reluctant—obscure and golden
    
	As water kindled with presage of dawn or night—
	A form, a face, a wonder to sense and sight,
	Grows great as the moon through the month; and her eyes embolden
	Fear, till it change to desire, and desire to delight.


	I sleep not: sleep would die of a dream so strange;
	A dream so sweet would die as a rainbow dies,
	As a sunbow laughs and is lost on the waves that range
	And reck not of light that flickers or spray that flies.
	But the sun withdraws not, the woodland shrinks not or sighs,
	No sweet thing sickens with sense or with fear of change;
	Light wounds not, darkness blinds not, my steadfast eyes.


	Only the soul in my sense that receives the soul
	Whence now my spirit is kindled with breathless bliss
	Knows well if the light that wounds it with love makes whole,
	If hopes that carol be louder than fears that hiss,
	If truth be spoken of flowers and of waves that kiss,
	Of clouds and stars that contend for a sunbright goal.
	And yet may I dream that I dream not indeed of this?


	An earth-born dreamer, constrained by the bonds of birth,
	Held fast by the flesh, compelled by his veins that beat
	And kindle to rapture or wrath, to desire or to mirth,
    
	May hear not surely the fall of immortal feet,
	May feel not surely if heaven upon earth be sweet;
	And here is my sense fulfilled of the joys of earth,
	Light, silence, bloom, shade, murmur of leaves that meet.


	Bloom, fervour, and perfume of grasses and flowers aglow,
	Breathe and brighten about me: the darkness gleams,
	The sweet light shivers and laughs on the slopes below,
	Made soft by leaves that lighten and change like dreams;
	The silence thrills with the whisper of secret streams
	That well from the heart of the woodland: these I know:
	Earth bore them, heaven sustained them with showers and beams.


	I lean my face to the heather, and drink the sun
	Whose flame-lit odour satiates the flowers: mine eyes
	Close, and the goal of delight and of life is one:
	No more I crave of earth or her kindred skies.
	No more? But the joy that springs from them smiles and flies:
	The sweet work wrought of them surely, the good work done,
	If the mind and the face of the season be loveless, dies.


	Thee, therefore, thee would I come to, cleave to, cling,
	If haply thy heart be kind and thy gifts be good,
    
	Unknown sweet spirit, whose vesture is soft in spring,
	In summer splendid, in autumn pale as the wood
	That shudders and wanes and shrinks as a shamed thing should,
	In winter bright as the mail of a war-worn king
	Who stands where foes fled far from the face of him stood.


	My spirit or thine is it, breath of thy life or of mine,
	Which fills my sense with a rapture that casts out fear?
	Pan's dim frown wanes, and his wild eyes brighten as thine,
	Transformed as night or as day by the kindling year.
	Earth-born, or mine eye were withered that sees, mine ear
	That hears were stricken to death by the sense divine,
	Earth-born I know thee: but heaven is about me here.


	The terror that whispers in darkness and flames in light,
	The doubt that speaks in the silence of earth and sea,
	The sense, more fearful at noon than in midmost night,
	Of wrath scarce hushed and of imminent ill to be,
	Where are they? Heaven is as earth, and as heaven to me
	Earth: for the shadows that sundered them here take flight;
	And nought is all, as am I, but a dream of thee.
