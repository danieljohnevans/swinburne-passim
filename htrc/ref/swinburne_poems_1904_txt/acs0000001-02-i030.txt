				Put in the sickles and reap;
				For the morning of harvest is red,
				And the long large ranks of the corn
				Coloured and clothed as the morn
				Stand thick in the fields and deep
				For them that faint to be fed.
				Let all that hunger and weep
				Come hither, and who would have bread
				Put in the sickles and reap.
			
			
				Coloured and clothed as the morn,
				The grain grows ruddier than gold,
				And the good strong sun is alight
				In the mists of the day-dawn white,
				And the crescent, a faint sharp horn,
				In the fear of his face turns cold
				As the snakes of the night-time that creep
				From the flag of our faith unrolled.
				Put in the sickles and reap.
			
			
				In the mists of the day-dawn white
				That roll round the morning star,
				The large flame lightens and grows
				Till the red-gold harvest-rows,
				Full-grown, are full of the light
				
				As the spirits of strong men are,
				Crying, Who shall slumber or sleep?
				Who put back morning or mar?
				Put in the sickles and reap.
			
			
				Till the red-gold harvest-rows
				For miles through shudder and shine
				In the wind's breath, fed with the sun,
				A thousand spear-heads as one
				Bowed as for battle to close
				Line in rank against line
				With place and station to keep
				Till all men's hands at a sign
				Put in the sickles and reap.
			
			
				A thousand spear-heads as one
				Wave as with swing of the sea
				When the mid tide sways at its height;
				For the hour is for harvest or fight
				In face of the just calm sun,
				As the signal in season may be
				And the lot in the helm may leap
				When chance shall shake it; but ye,
				Put in the sickles and reap.
			
			
				For the hour is for harvest or fight
				To clothe with raiment of red;
				O men sore stricken of hours,
				Lo, this one, is not it ours
				To glean, to gather, to smite?
				Let none make risk of his head
				Within reach of the clean scythe-sweep,
				When the people that lay as the dead
				Put in the sickles and reap.
			
			
			
				Lo, this one, is not it ours,
				Now the ruins of dead things rattle
				As dead men's bones in the pit,
				Now the kings wax lean as they sit
				Girt round with memories of powers,
				With musters counted as cattle
				And armies folded as sheep
				Till the red blind husbandman battle
				Put in the sickles and reap?
			
			
				Now the kings wax lean as they sit,
				The people grow strong to stand;
				The men they trod on and spat,
				The dumb dread people that sat
				As corpses cast in a pit,
				Rise up with God at their hand,
				And thrones are hurled on a heap,
				And strong men, sons of the land,
				Put in the sickles and reap.
			
			
				The dumb dread people that sat
				All night without screen for the night,
				All day without food for the day,
				They shall give not their harvest away,
				They shall eat of its fruit and wax fat:
				They shall see the desire of their sight,
				Though the ways of the seasons be steep,
				They shall climb with face to the light,
				Put in the sickles and reap.
