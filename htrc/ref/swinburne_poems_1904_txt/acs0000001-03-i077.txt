                    I
                
                
                    
                    Days dawn on us that make amends for many
                    
                    Sometimes,
                    When heaven and earth seem sweeter even than any
                    Man's rhymes.
                
                
                    Light had not all been quenched in France, or quelled
                    In Greece,
                    Had Homer sung not, or had Hugo held
                    His peace.
                
                
                    Had Sappho's self not left her word thus long
                    For token,
                    The sea round Lesbos yet in waves of song
                    Had spoken.
                
            
            
                
                    II
                
                
                    And yet these days of subtler air and finer
                    Delight,
                    When lovelier looks the darkness, and diviner
                    The light—
                
                
                
                    The gift they give of all these golden hours,
                    Whose urn
                    Pours forth reverberate rays or shadowing showers
                    In turn—
                
                
                    Clouds, beams, and winds that make the live day's track
                    Seem living—
                    What were they did no spirit give them back
                    Thanksgiving?
                
            
            
                
                    III
                
                
                    Dead air, dead fire, dead shapes and shadows, telling
                    Time nought;
                    Man gives them sense and soul by song, and dwelling
                    In thought.
                
                
                    In human thought their being endures, their power
                    Abides:
                    Else were their life a thing that each light hour
                    Derides.
                
                
                    The years live, work, sigh, smile, and die, with all
                    They cherish;
                    The soul endures, though dreams that fed it fall
                    And perish.
                
            
            
                
                    IV
                
                
                    In human thought have all things habitation;
                    Our days
                    Laugh, lower, and lighten past, and find no station
                    That stays.
                
                
                
                    But thought and faith are mightier things than time
                    Can wrong,
                    Made splendid once with speech, or made sublime
                    By song.
                
                
                    Remembrance, though the tide of change that rolls
                    Wax hoary,
                    Gives earth and heaven, for song's sake and the soul's,
                    Their glory.
                
                
                
                    July 16, 1885.
