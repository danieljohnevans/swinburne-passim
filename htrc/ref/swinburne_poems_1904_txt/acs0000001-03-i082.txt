                Farewell: how should not such as thou fare well,
                Though we fare ill that love thee, and that live,
                And know, whate'er the days wherein we dwell
                May give us, thee again they will not give?
            
            
                Peace, rest, and sleep are all we know of death,
                And all we dream of comfort: yet for thee,
                Whose breath of life was bright and strenuous breath,
                We think the change is other than we see.
            
            
                The seal of sleep set on thine eyes to-day
                Surely can seal not up the keen swift light
                That lit them once for ever. Night can slay
                None save the children of the womb of night.
            
            
                The fire that burns up dawn to bring forth noon
                Was father of thy spirit: how shouldst thou
                Die as they die for whom the sun and moon
                Are silent? Thee the darkness holds not now:
            
            
                Them, while they looked upon the light, and deemed
                That life was theirs for living in the sun,
                The darkness held in bondage: and they dreamed,
                Who knew not that such life as theirs was none.
            
            
            
                To thee the sun spake, and the morning sang
                Notes deep and clear as life or heaven: the sea
                That sounds for them but wild waste music rang
                Notes that were lost not when they rang for thee.
            
            
                The mountains clothed with light and night and change,
                The lakes alive with wind and cloud and sun,
                Made answer, by constraint sublime and strange,
                To the ardent hand that bade thy will be done.
            
            
                We may not bid the mountains mourn, the sea
                That lived and lightened from thine hand again
                Moan, as of old would men that mourned as we
                A man beloved, a man elect of men,
            
            
                A man that loved them. Vain, divine and vain,
                The dream that touched with thoughts or tears of ours
                The spirit of sense that lives in sun and rain,
                Sings out in birds, and breathes and fades in flowers.
            
            
                Not for our joy they live, and for our grief
                They die not. Though thine eye be closed, thine hand
                Powerless as mine to paint them, not a leaf
                In English woods or glades of Switzerland
            
            
                Falls earlier now, fades faster. All our love
                Moves not our mother's changeless heart, who gives
                A little light to eyes and stars above,
                A little life to each man's heart that lives.
            
            
            
                A little life to heaven and earth and sea,
                To stars and souls revealed of night and day,
                And change, the one thing changeless: yet shall she
                Cease too, perchance, and perish. Who shall say?
            
            
                Our mother Nature, dark and sweet as sleep,
                And strange as life and strong as death, holds fast,
                Even as she holds our hearts alive, the deep
                Dumb secret of her first-born births and last.
            
            
                But this, we know, shall cease not till the strife
                Of nights and days and fears and hopes find end;
                This, through the brief eternities of life,
                Endures, and calls from death a living friend;
            
            
                The love made strong with knowledge, whence confirmed
                The whole soul takes assurance, and the past
                (So by time's measure, not by memory's, termed)
                Lives present life, and mingles first with last.
            
            
                I, now long since thy guest of many days,
                Who found thy hearth a brother's, and with thee
                Tracked in and out the lines of rolling bays
                And banks and gulfs and reaches of the sea—
            
            
                Deep dens wherein the wrestling water sobs
                And pants with restless pain of refluent breath
                Till all the sunless hollow sounds and throbs
                With ebb and flow of eddies dark as death—
            
            
                I know not what more glorious world, what waves
                More bright with life,—if brighter aught may live
                Than those that filled and fled their tidal caves—
                May now give back the love thou hast to give.
            
            
            
                Tintagel, and the long Trebarwith sand,
                Lone Camelford, and Boscastle divine
                With dower of southern blossom, bright and bland
                Above the roar of granite-baffled brine,
            
            
                Shall hear no more by joyous night or day
                From downs or causeways good to rove and ride
                Or feet of ours or horse-hoofs urge their way
                That sped us here and there by tower and tide.
            
            
                The headlands and the hollows and the waves,
                For all our love, forget us: where I am
                Thou art not: deeper sleeps the shadow on graves
                Than in the sunless gulf that once we swam.
            
            
                Thou hast swum too soon the sea of death: for us
                Too soon, but if truth bless love's blind belief
                Faith, born of hope and memory, says not thus:
                And joy for thee for me should mean not grief.
            
            
                And joy for thee, if ever soul of man
                Found joy in change and life of ampler birth
                Than here pens in the spirit for a span,
                Must be the life that doubt calls death on earth.
            
            
                For if, beyond the shadow and the sleep,
                A place there be for souls without a stain,
                Where peace is perfect, and delight more deep
                Than seas or skies that change and shine again,
            
            
                There none of all unsullied souls that live
                May hold a surer station: none may lend
                More light to hope's or memory's lamp, nor give
                More joy than thine to those that called thee friend.
            
            
            
                Yea, joy from sorrow's barren womb is born
                When faith begets on grief the godlike child:
                As midnight yearns with starry sense of morn
                In Arctic summers, though the sea wax wild,
            
            
                So love, whose name is memory, thrills at heart,
                Remembering and rejoicing in thee, now
                Alive where love may dream not what thou art
                But knows that higher than hope or love art thou.
            
            
                Whatever heaven, if heaven at all may be,
                Await the sacred souls of good men dead,
                There, now we mourn who loved him here, is he.
                So, sweet and stern of speech, the Roman said,
            
            
                Erect in grief, in trust erect, and gave
                His deathless dead a deathless life even here
                Where day bears down on day as wave on wave
                And not man's smile fades faster than his tear.
            
            
                Albeit this gift be given not me to give,
                Nor power be mine to break time's silent spell,
                Not less shall love that dies not while I live
                Bid thee, beloved in life and death, farewell.
