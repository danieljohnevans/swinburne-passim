				Steadfast as sorrow, fiery sad, and sweet
				With underthoughts of love and faith, more strong
				Than doubt and hate and all ill thoughts which throng,
				Haply, round hope's or fear's world-wandering feet
				That find no rest from wandering till they meet
				Death, bearing palms in hand and crowns of song;
				His face, who thought to vanquish wrong with wrong,
				Erring, and make rage and redemption greet,
				Havoc and freedom; weaving in one weft
				Good with his right hand, evil with his left;
				But all a hero lived and erred and died;
				Looked thus upon the living world he left
				So bravely that with pity less than pride
				Men hail him Patriot and Tyrannicide.
