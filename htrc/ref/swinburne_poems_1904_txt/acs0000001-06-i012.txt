            (To A Tune of Blake's)
            
                I 
                
                    Baby, baby bright,
                    Sleep can steal from sight
                    Little of your light:
                
                
                    Soft as fire in dew,
                    Still the life in you
                    Lights your slumber through.
                
                
                    Four white eyelids keep
                    Fast the seal of sleep
                    Deep as love is deep:
                
                
                    Yet, though closed it lies,
                    Love behind them spies
                    Heaven in two blue eyes.
                
            
            
                II 
                
                    Baby, baby dear,
                    Earth and heaven are near
                    Now, for heaven is here.
                
                
                
                    Heaven is every place
                    Where your flower-sweet face
                    Fills our eyes with grace.
                
                
                    Till your own eyes deign
                    Earth a glance again,
                    Earth and heaven are twain.
                
                
                    Now your sleep is done,
                    Shine, and show the sun
                    Earth and heaven are one.
                
            
            
                III 
                
                    Baby, baby sweet,
                    Love's own lips are meet
                    Scarce to kiss your feet.
                
                
                    Hardly love's own ear,
                    When your laugh crows clear,
                    Quite deserves to hear.
                
                
                    Hardly love's own wile,
                    Though it please awhile,
                    Quite deserves your smile.
                
                
                    Baby full of grace,
                    Bless us yet a space:
                    Sleep will come apace.
                
            
            
                IV 
                
                    Baby, baby true,
                    Man, whate'er he do,
                    May deceive not you.
                
                
                
                    Smiles whose love is guile,
                    Worn a flattering while,
                    Win from you no smile.
                
                
                    One, the smile alone
                    Out of love's heart grown,
                    Ever wins your own.
                
                
                    Man, a dunce uncouth,
                    Errs in age and youth:
                    Babies know the truth.
                
            
            
                V 
                
                    Baby, baby fair,
                    Love is fain to dare
                    Bless your haughtiest air.
                
                
                    Baby blithe and bland,
                    Reach but forth a hand
                    None may dare withstand;
                
                
                    Love, though wellnigh cowed,
                    Yet would praise aloud
                    Pride so sweetly proud.
                
                
                    No! the fitting word
                    Even from breeze or bird
                    Never yet was heard.
                
            
            
                VI 
                
                    Baby, baby kind,
                    Though no word we find,
                    Bear us yet in mind.
                
                
                
                    Half a little hour,
                    Baby bright in bower,
                    Keep this thought aflower—
                
                
                    Love it is, I see,
                    Here with heart and knee
                    Bows and worships me.
                
                
                    What can baby do,
                    Then, for love so true?—
                    Let it worship you.
                
            
            
                VII 
                
                    Baby, baby wise,
                    Love's divine surmise
                    Lights your constant eyes.
                
                
                    Day and night and day
                    One mute word would they,
                    As the soul saith, say.
                
                
                    Trouble comes and goes;
                    Wonder ebbs and flows;
                    Love remains and glows.
                
                
                    As the fledgeling dove
                    Feels the breast above,
                    So your heart feels love.
