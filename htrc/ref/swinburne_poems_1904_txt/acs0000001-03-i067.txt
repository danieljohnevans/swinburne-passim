                Like queen enchanted who may not laugh or weep,
                Glad at heart and guarded from change and care like ours,
                Girt about with beauty by days and nights that creep
                Soft as breathless ripples that softly shoreward sweep,
                Lies the lovely city whose grace no grief deflowers.
                Age and grey forgetfulness, time that shifts and veers,
                Touch not thee, our fairest, whose charm no rival nears,
                Hailed as England's Florence of one whose praise gives grace,
                Landor, once thy lover, a name that love reveres:
                Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face.
            
            
                Dawn whereof we know not, and noon whose fruit we reap,
                Garnered up in record of years that fell like flowers,
                Sunset liker sunrise along the shining steep
                Whence thy fair face lightens, and where thy soft springs leap,
                Crown at once and gird thee with grace of guardian powers.
                
                Loved of men beloved of us, souls that fame inspheres,
                All thine air hath music for him who dreams and hears;
                Voices mixed of multitudes, feet of friends that pace,
                Witness why for ever, if heaven's face clouds or clears,
                Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face.
            
            
                Peace hath here found harbourage mild as very sleep:
                Not the hills and waters, the fields and wildwood bowers,
                Smile or speak more tenderly, clothed with peace more deep,
                Here than memory whispers of days our memories keep
                Fast with love and laughter and dreams of withered hours.
                Bright were these as blossom of old, and thought endears
                Still the fair soft phantoms that pass with smiles or tears,
                Sweet as roseleaves hoarded and dried wherein we trace
                Still the soul and spirit of sense that lives and cheers:
                Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face.
            
            
                City lulled asleep by the chime of passing years,
                Sweeter smiles thy rest than the radiance round thy peers;
                Only love and lovely remembrance here have place.
                Time on thee lies lighter than music on men's ears;
                Dawn and noon and sunset are one before thy face.
