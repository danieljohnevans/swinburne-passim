                				Abreast and ahead of the sea is a crag's front cloven asunder
                				With strong sea-breach and with wasting of winds whence terror is shed
                				As a shadow of death from the wings of the darkness on waters that thunder
                				Abreast and ahead.
                			
                			
                				At its edge is a sepulchre hollowed and hewn for a lone man's bed,
                				Propped open with rock and agape on the sky and the sea thereunder,
                				But roofed and walled in well from the wrath of them slept its dead.
                			
                			
                				Here might not a man drink rapture of rest, or delight above wonder,
                				Beholding, a soul disembodied, the days and the nights that fled,
                				With splendour and sound of the tempest around and above him and under,
                				Abreast and ahead?
