                Love , whose light thrills heaven and earth,

                Smiles and weeps upon thy birth,
                Child, whose mother's love-lit eyes
                Watch thee but from Paradise.
                Sweetest sight that earth can give,
                Sweetest light of eyes that live,
                Ours must needs, for hope withdrawn,
                Hail with tears thy soft spring dawn.
                Light of hope whose star hath set,
                Light of love whose sun lives yet,
                Holier, happier, heavenlier love
                Breathes about thee, burns above,
                Surely, sweet, than ours can be,
                Shed from eyes we may not see,
                Though thine own may see them shine
                Night and day, perchance, on thine.
                Sun and moon that lighten earth
                Seem not fit to bless thy birth:
                Scarce the very stars we know
                Here seem bright enough to show
                Whence in unimagined skies
                Glows the vigil of such eyes.
                Theirs whose heart is as a sea
                Swoln with sorrowing love of thee
                Fain would share with thine the sight
                Seen alone of babes aright,
                
                Watched of eyes more sweet than flowers
                Sleeping or awake: but ours
                Can but deem or dream or guess
                Thee not wholly motherless.
                Might they see or might they know
                What nor faith nor hope may show,
                We whose hearts yearn toward thee now
                Then were blest and wise as thou.
                Had we half thy knowledge,—had
                Love such wisdom,—grief were glad,
                Surely, lit by grace of thee;
                Life were sweet as death may be.
                Now the law that lies on men
                Bids us mourn our dead: but then
                Heaven and life and earth and death,
                Quickened as by God's own breath,
                All were turned from sorrow and strife:
                Earth and death were heaven and life.
                All too far are then and now
                Sundered: none may be as thou.
                Yet this grace is ours—a sign
                Of that goodlier grace of thine,
                Sweet, and thine alone—to see
                Heaven, and heaven's own love, in thee.
                Bless them, then, whose eyes caress
                Thee, as only thou canst bless.
                Comfort, faith, assurance, love,
                Shine around us, brood above,
                Fear grows hope, and hope grows wise,
                Thrilled and lit by children's eyes.
                Yet in ours the tears unshed,
                Child, for hope that death leaves dead,
                Needs must burn and tremble; thou
                Knowest not, seest not, why nor how,
                
                More than we know whence or why
                Comes on babes that laugh and lie
                Half asleep, in sweet-lipped scorn,
                Light of smiles outlightening morn,
                Whence enkindled as is earth
                By the dawn's less radiant birth
                All the body soft and sweet
                Smiles on us from face to feet
                When the rose-red hands would fain
                Reach the rose-red feet in vain.
                Eyes and hands that worship thee
                Watch and tend, adore and see
                All these heavenly sights, and give
                Thanks to see and love and live.
                Yet, of all that hold thee dear,
                Sweet, the dearest smiles not here.
                Thine alone is now the grace,
                Haply, still to see her face;
                Thine, thine only now the sight
                Whence we dream thine own takes light.
                Yet, though faith and hope live blind,
                Yet they live in heart and mind
                Strong and keen as truth may be:
                Yet, though blind as grief were we
                Inly for a weeping-while,
                Sorrow's self before thy smile
                Smiles and softens, knowing that yet,
                Far from us though heaven be set,
                Love, bowed down for thee to bless,
                Dares not call thee motherless.
            
            
                May 1894.
