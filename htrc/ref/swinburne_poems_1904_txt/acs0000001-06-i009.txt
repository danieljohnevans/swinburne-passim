            (1884)
            
                All Afric, winged with death and fire,
                Pants in our pleasant English air.
                Each blade of grass is tense as wire,
                And all the wood's loose trembling hair
                Stark in the broad and breathless glare
                Of hours whose touch wastes herb and tree.
                This bright sharp death shines everywhere;
                Life yearns for solace toward the sea.
            
            
                Earth seems a corpse upon the pyre;
                The sun, a scourge for slaves to bear.
                All power to fear, all keen desire,
                Lies dead as dreams of days that were
                Before the new-born world lay bare
                In heaven's wide eye, whereunder we
                Lie breathless till the season spare:
                Life yearns for solace toward the sea.
            
            
                Fierce hours, with ravening fangs that tire
                On spirit and sense, divide and share
                The throbs of thoughts that scarce respire,
                The throes of dreams that scarce forbear
                
                One mute immitigable prayer
                For cold perpetual sleep to be
                Shed snowlike on the sense of care.
                Life yearns for solace toward the sea.
            
            
                The dust of ways where men suspire
                Seems even the dust of death's dim lair.
                But though the feverish days be dire
                The sea-wind rears and cheers its fair
                Blithe broods of babes that here and there
                Make the sands laugh and glow for glee
                With gladder flowers than gardens wear.
                Life yearns for solace toward the sea.
            
            
                The music dies not off the lyre
                That lets no soul alive despair.
                Sleep strikes not dumb the breathless choir
                Of waves whose note bids sorrow spare.
                As glad they sound, as fast they fare,
                As when fate's word first set them free
                And gave them light and night to wear.
                Life yearns for solace toward the sea.
            
            
                For there, though night and day conspire
                To compass round with toil and snare
                And changeless whirl of change, whose gyre
                Draws all things deathwards unaware,
                The spirit of life they scourge and scare,
                Wild waves that follow on waves that flee
                Laugh, knowing that yet, though earth despair,
                Life yearns for solace toward the sea.
