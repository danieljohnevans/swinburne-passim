                O love! what shall be said of thee?
                The son of grief begot by joy?
                Being sightless, wilt thou see?
                Being sexless, wilt thou be
                Maiden or boy?
            
            
                I dreamed of strange lips yesterday
                And cheeks wherein the ambiguous blood
                Was like a rose’s — yea,
                A rose’s when it lay
                Within the bud.
            
            
                What fields have bred thee, or what groves
                Concealed thee, O mysterious flower,
                O double rose of Love’s,
                With leaves that lure the doves
                From bud to bower?
            
            
                I dare not kiss it, lest my lip
                Press harder than an indrawn breath,
                And all the sweet life slip
                Forth, and the sweet leaves drip,
                Bloodlike, in death.
            
            
                O sole desire of my delight!
                O sole delight of my desire!
                
                Mine eyelids and eyesight
                Feed on thee day and night
                Like lips of fire.
            
            
                Lean back thy throat of carven pearl,
                Let thy mouth murmur like the dove’s;
                Say, Venus hath no girl,
                No front of female curl,
                Among her Loves.
            
            
                Thy sweet low bosom, thy close hair,
                Thy strait soft flanks and slenderer feet,
                Thy virginal strange air,
                Are these not over fair
                For Love to greet?
            
            
                How should he greet thee? what new name,
                Fit to move all men’s hearts, could move
                Thee, deaf to love or shame,
                Love’s sister, by the same
                Mother as Love?
            
            
                Ah sweet, the maiden’s mouth is cold,
                Her breast-blossoms are simply red,
                Her hair mere brown or gold,
                Fold over simple fold
                Binding her head.
            
            
                Thy mouth is made of fire and wine,
                Thy barren bosom takes my kiss
                And turns my soul to thine
                And turns thy lip to mine,
                And mine it is.
            
            
            
                Thou hast a serpent in thine hair,
                In all the curls that close and cling;
                And ah, thy breast-flower!
                Ah love, thy mouth too fair
                To kiss and sting!
            
            
                Cleave to me, love me, kiss mine eyes,
                Satiate thy lips with loving me;
                Nay, for thou shalt not rise;
                Lie still as Love that dies
                For love of thee.
            
            
                Mine arms are close about thine head,
                My lips are fervent on thy face,
                And where my kiss hath fed
                Thy flower-like blood leaps red
                To the kissed place.
            
            
                O bitterness of things too sweet!
                O broken singing of the dove!
                Love’s wings are over fleet,
                And like the panther’s feet
                The feet of Love.
