                Dante, sole standing on the heavenward height,
                Beheld and heard one saying, Behold me well:
                I am, I am Beatrice. Heaven and hell
                Kept silence, and the illimitable light
                Of all the stars was darkness in his sight
                Whose eyes beheld her eyes again, and fell
                Shame-stricken. Since her soul took flight to dwell
                In heaven, six hundred years have taken flight.
            
            
                And now that heavenliest part of earth whereon
                Shines yet their shadow as once their presence shone
                To her bears witness for his sake, as he
                For hers bare witness when her face was gone:
                No slave, no hospice now for griefâ€”but free
                From shore to mountain and from Alp to sea.
