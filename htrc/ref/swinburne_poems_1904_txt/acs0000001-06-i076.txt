                The coming of the hawthorn brings on earth
                Heaven: all the spring speaks out in one sweet word,
                And heaven grows gladder, knowing that earth has heard.
                Ere half the flowers are jubilant in birth,
                The splendour of the laughter of their mirth
                Dazzles delight with wonder: man and bird
                Rejoice and worship, stilled at heart and stirred
                With rapture girt about with awe for girth.
            
            
                The passing of the hawthorn takes away
                Heaven: all the spring falls dumb, and all the soul
                Sinks down in man for sorrow. Night and day
                Forego the joy that made them one and whole.
                The change that falls on every starry spray
                Bids, flower by flower, the knell of springtime toll.
