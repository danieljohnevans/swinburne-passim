    					I
    					
    						
    						Queen , for whose house my fathers fought,
    						
    						With hopes that rose and fell,
    						Red star of boyhood's fiery thought,
    						Farewell.
    					
    					
    						They gave their lives, and I, my queen,
    						Have given you of my life,
    						Seeing your brave star burn high between
    						Men's strife.
    					
    					
    						The strife that lightened round their spears
    						Long since fell still: so long
    						Hardly may hope to last in years
    						My song.
    					
    					
    						But still through strife of time and thought
    						Your light on me too fell:
    						Queen, in whose name we sang or fought,
    						Farewell.
    					
    				
    				
    					II
    					
    						There beats no heart on either border
    						Wherethrough the north blasts blow
    						But keeps your memory as a warder
    						His beacon-fire aglow.
    					
    					
    					
    						Long since it fired with love and wonder
    						Mine, for whose April age
    						Blithe midsummer made banquet under
    						The shade of Hermitage.
    					
    					
    						Soft sang the burn's blithe notes, that gather
    						Strength to ring true:
    						And air and trees and sun and heather
    						Remembered you.
    					
    					
    						Old border ghosts of fight or fairy
    						Or love or teen,
    						These they forgot, remembering Mary
    						The Queen.
    					
    				
    				
    					III
    					
    						Queen once of Scots and ever of ours
    						Whose sires brought forth for you
    						Their lives to strew your way like flowers,
    						Adieu.
    					
    					
    						Dead is full many a dead man's name
    						Who died for you this long
    						Time past: shall this too fare the same,
    						My song?
    					
    					
    						But surely, though it die or live,
    						Your face was worth
    						All that a man may think to give
    						On earth.
    					
    					
    						No darkness cast of years between
    						Can darken you:
    						Man's love will never bid my queen
    						Adieu.
    					
    				
    				
    				
    					IV
    					
    						Love hangs like light about your name
    						As music round the shell:
    						No heart can take of you a tame
    						Farewell.
    					
    					
    						Yet, when your very face was seen,
    						Ill gifts were yours for giving:
    						Love gat strange guerdons of my queen
    						When living.
    					
    					
    						O diamond heart unflawed and clear,
    						The whole world's crowning jewel!
    						Was ever heart so deadly dear
    						So cruel?
    					
    					
    						Yet none for you of all that bled
    						Grudged once one drop that fell:
    						Not one to life reluctant said
    						Farewell.
    					
    				
    				
    					V
    					
    						Strange love they have given you, love disloyal,
    						Who mock with praise your name,
    						To leave a head so rare and royal
    						Too low for praise or blame.
    					
    					
    						You could not love nor hate, they tell us,
    						You had nor sense nor sting:
    						In God's name, then, what plague befell us
    						To fight for such a thing?
    					
    					
    					
    						Some faults the gods will give, to fetter
    						Man's highest intent:
    						But surely you were something better
    						Than innocent!
    					
    					
    						No maid that strays with steps unwary
    						Through snares unseen,
    						But one to live and die for; Mary,
    						The Queen.
    					
    				
    				
    					VI
    					
    						Forgive them all their praise, who blot
    						Your fame with praise of you:
    						Then love may say, and falter not,
    						Adieu.
    					
    					
    						Yet some you hardly would forgive
    						Who did you much less wrong
    						Once: but resentment should not live
    						Too long.
    					
    					
    						They never saw your lip's bright bow,
    						Your swordbright eyes,
    						The bluest of heavenly things below
    						The skies.
    					
    					
    						Clear eyes that love's self finds most like
    						A swordblade's blue,
    						A swordblade's ever keen to strike,
    						Adieu.
    					
    				
    				
    				
    					VII
    					
    						Though all things breathe or sound of fight
    						That yet make up your spell,
    						To bid you were to bid the light
    						Farewell.
    					
    					
    						Farewell the song says only, being
    						A star whose race is run:
    						Farewell the soul says never, seeing
    						The sun.
    					
    					
    						Yet, wellnigh as with flash of tears,
    						The song must say but so
    						That took your praise up twenty years
    						Ago.
    					
    					
    						More bright than stars or moons that vary,
    						Sun kindling heaven and hell,
    						Here, after all these years, Queen Mary,
    						Farewell.
