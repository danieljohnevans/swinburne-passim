    					How low soe'er men rank us,
    					
    					How high soe'er we win,
    					The children far above us
    					Dwell, and they deign to love us,
    					With lovelier love than ours,
    					And smiles more sweet than flowers;
    					As though the sun should thank us
    					For letting light come in.
    				
    				
    					With too divine complaisance,
    					Whose grace misleads them thus,
    					Being gods, in heavenly blindness
    					They call our worship kindness,
    					Our pebble-gift a gem:
    					They think us good to them,
    					Whose glance, whose breath, whose presence,
    					Are gifts too good for us.
    				
    				
    					The poet high and hoary
    					Of meres that mountains bind
    					Felt his great heart more often
    					Yearn, and its proud strength soften
    					From stern to tenderer mood,
    					At thought of gratitude
    					Shown than of song or story
    					He heard of hearts unkind.
    				
    				
    				
    					But with what words for token
    					And what adoring tears
    					Of reverence risen to passion,
    					In what glad prostrate fashion
    					Of spirit and soul subdued,
    					May man show gratitude
    					For thanks of children spoken
    					That hover in his ears?
    				
    				
    					The angels laugh, your brothers,
    					Child, hearing you thank me,
    					With eyes whence night grows sunny,
    					And touch of lips like honey,
    					And words like honey-dew:
    					But how shall I thank you?
    					For gifts above all others
    					What guerdon-gift may be?
    				
    				
    					What wealth of words caressing,
    					What choice of songs found best,
    					Would seem not as derision,
    					Found vain beside the vision
    					And glory from above
    					Shown in a child's heart's love?
    					His part in life is blessing;
    					Ours, only to be blest.
