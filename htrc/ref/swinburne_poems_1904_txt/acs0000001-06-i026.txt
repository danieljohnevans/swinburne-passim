                I
                A word across the water
                Against our ears is borne,
                Of threatenings and of slaughter,
                Of rage and spite and scorn:
                We have not, alack, an ally to befriend us,
                And the season is ripe to extirpate and end us:
                Let the German touch hands with the Gaul,
                And the fortress of England must fall;
                And the sea shall be swept of her seamen,
                And the waters they ruled be their graves,
                And Dutchmen and Frenchmen be free men,
                And Englishmen slaves.
            
            
                II
                Our time once more is over,
                Once more our end is near:
                A bull without a drover,
                The Briton reels to rear,
                And the van of the nations is held by his betters,
                And the seas of the world shall be loosed from his fetters,
                And his glory shall pass as a breath,
                And the life that is in him be death;
                
                And the sepulchre sealed on his glory
                For a sign to the nations shall be
                As of Tyre and of Carthage in story,
                Once lords of the sea.
            
            
                III
                The lips are wise and loyal,
                The hearts are brave and true,
                Imperial thoughts and royal
                Make strong the clamorous crew,
                Whence louder and prouder the noise of defiance
                Rings rage from the grave of a trustless alliance,
                And bids us beware and be warned,
                As abhorred of all nations and scorned,
                As a swordless and spiritless nation,
                A wreck on the waste of the waves.
                So foams the released indignation
                Of masterless slaves.
            
            
                IV
                Brute throats that miss the collar,
                Bowed backs that ask the whip,
                Stretched hands that lack the dollar,
                And many a lie-seared lip,
                Forefeel and foreshow for us signs as funereal
                As the signs that were regal of yore and imperial;
                We shall pass as the princes they served,
                We shall reap what our fathers deserved,
                And the place that was England's be taken
                By one that is worthier than she,
                And the yoke of her empire be shaken
                Like spray from the sea.
            
            
            
                V
                French hounds, whose necks are aching
                Still from the chain they crave,
                In dog-day madness breaking
                The dog-leash, thus may rave:
                But the seas that for ages have fostered and fenced her
                Laugh, echoing the yell of their kennel against her
                And their moan if destruction draw near them
                And the roar of her laughter to hear them;
                For she knows that if Englishmen be men
                Their England has all that she craves;
                All love and all honour from free men,
                All hatred from slaves.
            
            
                VI
                All love that rests upon her
                Like sunshine and sweet air,
                All light of perfect honour
                And praise that ends in prayer,
                She wins not more surely, she wears not more proudly,
                Than the token of tribute that clatters thus loudly,
                The tribute of foes when they meet
                That rattles and rings at her feet,
                The tribute of rage and of rancour,
                The tribute of slaves to the free,
                To the people whose hope hath its anchor
                Made fast in the sea.
            
            
            
                VII
                No fool that bows the back he
                Feels fit for scourge or brand,
                No scurril scribes that lackey
                The lords of Lackeyland,
                No penman that yearns, as he turns on his pallet,
                For the place or the pence of a peer or a valet,
                No whelp of as currish a pack
                As the litter whose yelp it gives back,
                Though he answer the cry of his brother
                As echoes might answer from caves,
                Shall be witness as though for a mother
                Whose children were slaves.
            
            
                VIII
                But those found fit to love her,
                Whose love has root in faith,
                Who hear, though darkness cover
                Time's face, what memory saith,
                Who seek not the service of great men or small men
                But the weal that is common for comfort of all men,
                Those yet that in trust have beholden
                Truth's dawn over England grow golden
                And quicken the darkness that stagnates
                And scatter the shadows that flee,
                Shall reply for her meanest as magnates
                And masters by sea.
            
            
                IX
                And all shall mark her station,
                Her message all shall hear,
                When, equal-eyed, the nation
                Bids all her sons draw near,
                
                And freedom be more than tradition or faction,
                And thought be no swifter to serve her than action,
                And justice alone be above her,
                That love may be prouder to love her,
                And time on the crest of her story
                Inscribe, as remembrance engraves,
                The sign that subdues with its glory
                Kings, princes, and slaves.
