    						Affectionately inscribed to W. M. R. and L. R.
    					
    				
    				
    					
    						April, on whose wings
    						Ride all gracious things,
    						Like the star that brings
    						All things good to man,
    						Ere his light, that yet
    						Makes the month shine, set,
    						And fair May forget
    						Whence her birth began,
    					
    					
    						Brings, as heart would choose,
    						Sound of golden news,
    						Bright as kindling dews
    						When the dawn begins;
    						Tidings clear as mirth,
    						Sweet as air and earth
    						Now that hail the birth,
    						Twice thus blest, of twins.
    					
    					
    						In the lovely land
    						Where with hand in hand
    						Lovers wedded stand
    						Other joys before
    						Made your mixed life sweet:
    						Now, as Time sees meet,
    						Three glad blossoms greet
    						Two glad blossoms more.
    					
    					
    					
    						Fed with sun and dew,
    						While your joys were new,
    						First arose and grew
    						One bright olive-shoot:
    						Then a fair and fine
    						Slip of warm-haired pine
    						Felt the sweet sun shine
    						On its leaf and fruit.
    					
    					
    						And it wore for mark
    						Graven on the dark
    						Beauty of its bark
    						That the noblest name
    						Worn in song of old
    						By the king whose bold
    						Hand had fast in hold
    						All the flower of fame.
    					
    					
    						Then, with southern skies
    						Flattered in her eyes,
    						Which, in lovelier wise
    						Yet, reflect their blue
    						Brightened more, being bright
    						Here with life's delight,
    						And with love's live light
    						Glorified anew,
    					
    					
    						Came, as fair as came
    						One who bore her name
    						(She that broke as flame
    						From the swan-shell white),
    						Crowned with tender hair
    						Only, but more fair
    						Than all queens that were
    						Themes of oldworld fight,
    					
    					
    					
    						Of your flowers the third
    						Bud, or new-fledged bird
    						In your hearts' nest heard
    						Murmuring like a dove
    						Bright as those that drew
    						Over waves where blew
    						No loud wind the blue
    						Heaven-hued car of love.
    					
    					
    						Not the glorious grace
    						Even of that one face
    						Potent to displace
    						All the towers of Troy
    						Surely shone more clear
    						Once with childlike cheer
    						Than this child's face here
    						Now with living joy.
    					
    					
    						After these again
    						Here in April's train
    						Breaks the bloom of twain
    						Blossoms in one birth
    						For a crown of May
    						On the front of day
    						When he takes his way
    						Over heaven and earth.
    					
    					
    						Half a heavenly thing
    						Given from heaven to Spring
    						By the sun her king,
    						Half a tender toy,
    						Seems a child of curl
    						Yet too soft to twirl;
    						Seems the flower-sweet girl
    						By the flower-bright boy.
    					
    					
    					
    						All the kind gods' grace,
    						All their love, embrace
    						Ever either face,
    						Ever brood above them:
    						All soft wings of hours
    						Screen them as with flowers
    						From all beams and showers:
    						All life's seasons love them.
    					
    					
    						When the dews of sleep
    						Falling lightliest keep
    						Eyes too close to peep
    						Forth and laugh off rest,
    						Joy from face to feet
    						Fill them, as is meet:
    						Life to them be sweet
    						As their mother's breast.
    					
    					
    						When those dews are dry,
    						And in day's bright eye
    						Looking full they lie
    						Bright as rose and pearl,
    						All returns of joy
    						Pure of time's alloy
    						Bless the rose-red boy,
    						Guard the rose-white girl
    					
    				
    				
    					Postscript
    					
    						Friends, if I could take
    						Half a note from Blake
    						Or but one verse make
    						Of the Conqueror's mine,
    						
    						Better than my best
    						Song above your nest
    						I would sing: the quest
    						Now seems too divine.
