                βᾶτε δόμον, μεγάλοι φιλοτίμοι
                Νυκτὸς παῖδες ἄπαιδες, ὑπ’ εὔφρονι πομπᾷ.
            
            
                I
                O great and wise, clear-souled and high of heart,
                One the last flower of Catholic love, that grows
                Amid bare thorns their only thornless rose,
                From the fierce juggling of the priests' loud mart
                Yet alien, yet unspotted and apart
                From the blind hard foul rout whose shameless shows
                Mock the sweet heaven whose secret no man knows
                With prayers and curses and the soothsayer's art;
                One like a storm-god of the northern foam
                Strong, wrought of rock that breasts and breaks the sea
                And thunders back its thunder, rhyme for rhyme
                Answering, as though to outroar the tides of time
                And bid the world's wave back—what song should be
                Theirs that with praise would bring and sing you home?
            
            
            
                II
                With all our hearts we praise you whom ye hate,
                High souls that hate us; for our hopes are higher,
                And higher than yours the goal of our desire,
                Though high your ends be as your hearts are great.
                Your world of Gods and kings, of shrine and state,
                Was of the night when hope and fear stood nigher,
                Wherein men walked by light of stars and fire
                Till man by day stood equal with his fate.
                Honour not hate we give you, love not fear,
                Last prophets of past kind, who fill the dome
                Of great dead Gods with wrath and wail, nor hear
                Time's word and man's: Go honoured hence, go home,
                Night's childless children; here your hour is done;
                Pass with the stars, and leave us with the sun.
