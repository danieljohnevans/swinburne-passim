                Hippolytus.
                
                    Lay not thine hand upon me; let me go;
                    Take off thine eyes that put the gods to shame;
                    What, wilt thou turn my loathing to thy death?
                
            
            
                Phædra.
                
                    Nay, I will never loosen hold nor breathe
                    Till thou have slain me; godlike for great brows
                    Thou art, and thewed as gods are, with clear hair:
                    Draw now thy sword and smite me as thou art god,
                    For verily I am smitten of other gods,
                    Why not of thee?
                
            
            
                Chorus.
                
                    O queen, take heed of words;
                    Why wilt thou eat the husk of evil speech?
                    Wear wisdom for that veil about thy head
                    And goodness for the binding of thy brows.
                
            
            
                Phædra.
                
                    Nay, but this god hath cause enow to smite;
                    If he will slay me, baring breast and throat,
                    I lean toward the stroke with silent mouth
                    And a great heart. Come, take thy sword and slay;
                    
                    Let me not starve between desire and death,
                    But send me on my way with glad wet lips;
                    For in the vein-drawn ashen-coloured palm
                    Death’s hollow hand holds water of sweet draught
                    To dip and slake dried mouths at, as a deer
                    Specked red from thorns laps deep and loses pain.
                    Yea, if mine own blood ran upon my mouth,
                    I would drink that. Nay, but be swift with me;
                    Set thy sword here between the girdle and breast,
                    For I shall grow a poison if I live.Full stop is missing at the end of the line in the 1904 edition, but appears in other editions of Poems and Ballads, First Series and subsequent editions of the collected Poems.
                    Are not my cheeks as grass, my body pale,
                    And my breath like a dying poisoned man’s?
                    O whatsoever of godlike names thou be,
                    By thy chief name I charge thee, thou strong god,
                    And bid thee slay me. Strike, up to the gold,
                    Up to the hand-grip of the hilt; strike here;
                    For I am Cretan of my birth; strike now;
                    For I am Theseus’ wife; stab up to the rims,
                    I am born daughter to Pasiphae.
                    See thou spare not for greatness of my blood,
                    Nor for the shining letters of my name:
                    Make thy sword sure inside thine hand and smite,
                    For the bright writing of my name is black,
                    And I am sick with hating the sweet sun.

                    Let not this woman wail and cleave to me,
                    That am no part of the gods’ wrath with her;
                    Loose ye her hands from me lest she take hurt.

                    Lady, this speech and majesty are twain;
                    Pure shame is of one counsel with the gods.

                    Man is as beast when shame stands off from him.
                
            
            
                Phædra.
                
                    Man, what have I to do with shame or thee?
                    I am not of one counsel with the gods.
                    I am their kin, I have strange blood in me,
                    I am not of their likeness nor of thine:
                    My veins are mixed, and therefore am I mad,
                    Yea therefore chafe and turn on mine own flesh,
                    Half of a woman made with half a god.
                    But thou wast hewn out of an iron womb
                    And fed with molten mother-snow for milk.
                    A sword was nurse of thine; Hippolyta,
                    That had the spear to father, and the axe
                    To bridesman, and wet blood of sword-slain men
                    For wedding-water out of a noble well,
                    Even she did bear thee, thinking of a sword,
                    And thou wast made a man mistakingly.
                    Nay, for I love thee, I will have thy hands,
                    Nay, for I will not loose thee, thou art sweet,
                    Thou art my son, I am thy father’s wife,
                    I ache toward thee with a bridal blood,
                    The pulse is heavy in all my married veins,
                    My whole face beats, I will feed full of thee,
                    My body is empty of ease, I will be fed,
                    I am burnt to the bone with love, thou shalt not go,
                    I am heartsick, and mine eyelids prick mine eyes,
                    Thou shalt not sleep nor eat nor say a word
                    Till thou hast slain me. I am not good to live.
                
            
            
                Chorus.
                
                    This is an evil born with all its teeth,
                    When love is cast out of the bound of love.
                
            
            
            
                Hippolytus.
                
                    There is no hate that is so hateworthy.
                
            
            
                Phædra.
                
                    I pray thee turn that hate of thine my way,
                    I hate not it nor anything of thine.
                    Lo, maidens, how he burns about the brow,
                    And draws the chafing sword-strap down his hand.
                    What wilt thou do? wilt thou be worse than death?
                    Be but as sweet as is the bitterest,
                    The most dispiteous out of all the gods,
                    I am well pleased. Lo, do I crave so much?
                    I do but bid thee be unmerciful,
                    Even the one thing thou art. Pity me not:
                    Thou wert not quick to pity. Think of me
                    As of a thing thy hounds are keen upon
                    In the wet woods between the windy ways,
                    And slay me for a spoil. This body of mine
                    Is worth a wild beast’s fell or hide of hair,
                    And spotted deeper than a panther’s grain.
                    I were but dead if thou wert pure indeed;
                    I pray thee by thy cold green holy crown
                    And by the fillet-leaves of Artemis.
                    Nay, but thou wilt not. Death is not like thee,
                    Albeit men hold him worst of all the gods.
                    For of all gods Death only loves not gifts,
                    Nor with burnt-offering nor blood-sacrifice
                    Shalt thou do aught to get thee grace of him;
                    He will have nought of altar and altar-song,
                    And from him only of all the lords in heaven
                    Persuasion turns a sweet averted mouth.

                    But thou art worse: from thee with baffled breath
                    Back on my lips my prayer falls like a blow,
                    And beats upon them, dumb. What shall I say?
                    There is no word I can compel thee with
                    To do me good and slay me. But take heed;
                    I say, be wary; look between thy feet,
                    Lest a snare take them though the ground be good.
                
            
            
                Hippolytus.
                
                    Shame may do most where fear is found most weak;
                    That which for shame’s sake yet I have not done,
                    Shall it be done for fear’s? Take thine own way;
                    Better the foot slip than the whole soul swerve.

                    O women, O sweet people of this land,
                    O goodly city and pleasant ways thereof,
                    And woods with pasturing grass and great well-heads,
                    And hills with light and night between your leaves,
                    And winds with sound and silence in your lips,
                    And earth and water and all immortal things,
                    I take you to my witness what I am.
                    There is a god about me like as fire,
                    Sprung whence, who knoweth, or who hath heart to say?
                    A god more strong than whom slain beasts can soothe,
                    Or honey, or any spilth of blood-like wine,
                    Nor shall one please him with a whitened brow
                    Nor wheat nor wool nor aught of plaited leaf.
                    For like my mother am I stung and slain,
                    And round my cheeks have such red malady
                    And on my lips such fire and foam as hers.
                    This is that Ate out of Amathus
                    That breeds up death and gives it one for love.
                    She hath slain mercy, and for dead mercy’s sake
                    (Being frighted with this sister that was slain)
                    Flees from before her fearful-footed shame,
                    And will not bear the bending of her brows
                    And long soft arrows flown from under them
                    As from bows bent. Desire flows out of her
                    As out of lips doth speech: and over her
                    Shines fire, and round her and beneath her fire.
                    She hath sown pain and plague in all our house,
                    Love loathed of love, and mates unmatchable,
                    Wild wedlock, and the lusts that bleat or low,
                    
                    And marriage-fodder snuffed about of kine.
                    Lo how the heifer runs with leaping flank
                    Sleek under shaggy and speckled lies of hair,
                    And chews a horrible lip, and with harsh tongue
                    Laps alien froth and licks a loathlier mouth.
                    Alas, a foul first steam of trodden tares,
                    And fouler of these late grapes underfoot.
                    A bitter way of waves and clean-cut foam
                    Over the sad road of sonorous sea
                    The high gods gave king Theseus for no love,
                    Nay, but for love, yet to no loving end.
                    Alas the long thwarts and the fervent oars,
                    And blown hard sails that straightened the scant rope!
                    There were no strong pools in the hollow sea
                    To drag at them and suck down side and beak,
                    No wind to catch them in the teeth and hair,
                    No shoal, no shallow among the roaring reefs,
                    No gulf whereout the straining tides throw spars,
                    No surf where white bones twist like whirled white fire.
                    But like to death he came with death, and sought
                    And slew and spoiled and gat him that he would.
                    For death, for marriage, and for child-getting,
                    I set my curse against him as a sword;
                    Yea, and the severed half thereof I leave
                    Pittheus, because he slew not (when that face
                    Was tender, and the life still soft in it)
                    The small swathed child, but bred him for my fate.
                    I would I had been the first that took her death
                    Out from between wet hoofs and reddened teeth,
                    Splashed horns, fierce fetlocks of the brother bull!
                    For now shall I take death a deadlier way,
                    Gathering it up between the feet of love
                    Or off the knees of murder reaching it.
