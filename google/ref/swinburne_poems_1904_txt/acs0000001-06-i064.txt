                If the rose of all flowers be the rarest
                That heaven may adore from above,
                And the fervent moss-rose be the fairest
                That sweetens the summer with love,
            
            
                Can it be that a fairer than any
                Should blossom afar from the tree?
                Yet one, and a symbol of many,
                Shone sudden for eyes that could see.
            
            
                In the grime and the gloom of November
                The bliss and the bloom of July
                Bade autumn rejoice and remember
                The balm of the blossoms gone by.
            
            
                Would you know what moss-rose now it may be
                That puts all the rest to the blush,
                The flower was the face of a baby,
                The moss was a bonnet of plush.
