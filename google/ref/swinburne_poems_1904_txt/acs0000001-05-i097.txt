    					I
    					Sun, whom the faltering snow-cloud fears,
    					Rise, let the time of year be May,
    					Speak now the word that April hears,
    					Let March have all his royal way;
    					Bid all spring raise in winter's ears
    					All tunes her children hear or play,
    					Because the crown of eight glad years
    					On one bright head is set to-day.
    				
    				
    					II
    					What matters cloud or sun to-day
    					To him who wears the wreath of years
    					So many, and all like flowers at play
    					With wind and sunshine, while his ears
    					Hear only song on every way?
    					More sweet than spring triumphant hears
    					Ring through the revel-rout of May
    					Are these, the notes that winter fears.
    				
    				
    					III
    					Strong-hearted winter knows and fears
    					The music made of love at play,
    					Or haply loves the tune he hears
    					From hearts fulfilled with flowering May,
    					
    					Whose molten music thaws his ears
    					Late frozen, deaf but yesterday
    					To sounds of dying and dawning years,
    					Now quickened on his deathward way.
    				
    				
    					IV
    					For deathward now lies winter's way
    					Down the green vestibule of years
    					That each year brightens day by day
    					With flower and shower till hope scarce fears
    					And fear grows wholly hope of May.
    					But weâ€”the music in our ears
    					Made of love's pulses as they play
    					The heart alone that makes it hears.
    				
    				
    					V
    					The heart it is that plays and hears
    					High salutation of to-day.
    					Tongue falters, hand shrinks back, song fears
    					Its own unworthiness to play
    					Fit music for those eight sweet years,
    					Or sing their blithe accomplished way.
    					No song quite worth a young child's ears
    					Broke ever even from birds in May.
    				
    				
    					VI
    					There beats not in the heart of May,
    					When summer hopes and springtide fears,
    					There falls not from the height of day,
    					When sunlight speaks and silence hears,
    					
    					So sweet a psalm as children play
    					And sing, each hour of all their years,
    					Each moment of their lovely way,
    					And know not how it thrills our ears.
    				
    				
    					VII
    					Ah child, what are we, that our ears
    					Should hear you singing on your way,
    					Should have this happiness? The years
    					Whose hurrying wings about us play
    					Are not like yours, whose flower-time fears
    					Nought worse than sunlit showers in May,
    					Being sinless as the spring, that hears
    					Her own heart praise her every day.
    				
    				
    					VIII
    					Yet we too triumph in the day
    					That bare, to entrance our eyes and ears,
    					To lighten daylight, and to play
    					Such notes as darkness knows and fears,
    					The child whose face illumes our way,
    					Whose voice lifts up the heart that hears,
    					Whose hand is as the hand of May
    					To bring us flowers from eight full years.
    				
    				
    					February 4, 1882.
