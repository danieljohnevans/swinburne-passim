            (with a copy of Mademoiselle de Maupin)
            
                This is the golden book of spirit and sense,
                The holy writ of beauty; he that wrought
                Made it with dreams and faultless words and thought
                That seeks and finds and loses in the dense
                Dim air of life that beauty's excellence
                Wherewith love makes one hour of life distraught
                And all hours after follow and find not aught.
                Here is that height of all love's eminence
                Where man may breathe but for a breathing-space
                And feel his soul burn as an altar-fire
                To the unknown God of unachieved desire,
                And from the middle mystery of the place
                Watch lights that break, hear sounds as of a quire,
                But see not twice unveiled the veiled God's face.
