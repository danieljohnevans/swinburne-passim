                Storm, strong with all the bitter heart of hate,
                Smote England, now nineteen dark years ago,
                As when the tide's full wrath in seaward flow
                Smites and bears back the swimmer. Fraud and fate
                Were leagued against her: fear was fain to prate
                Of honour in dishonour, pride brought low,
                And humbleness whence holiness must grow,
                And greatness born of shame to be so great.
            
            
                The winter day that withered hope and pride
                Shines now triumphal on the turning tide
                That sets once more our trust in freedom free,
                That leaves a ruthless and a truthless foe
                And all base hopes that hailed his cause laid low,
                And England's name a light on land and sea.
            
            February 27, 1900.
