                				I 
                				VENTIMIGLIA
                				
                					The sky and sea glared hard and bright and blank:
                					Down the one steep street, with slow steps firm and free,
                					A tall girl paced, with eyes too proud to thank
                					The sky and sea.
                				
                				
                					One dead flat sapphire, void of wrath or glee,
                					Through bay on bay shone blind from bank to bank
                					The weary Mediterranean, drear to see.
                				
                				
                					More deep, more living, shone her eyes that drank
                					The breathless light and shed again on me,
                					Till pale before their splendour waned and shrank
                					The sky and sea.
                				
                			
                			            
                				II 
                				GENOA
                				
                					Again the same strange might of eyes, that saw
                					In heaven and earth nought fairer, overcame
                					My sight with rapture of reiterate awe,
                					Again the same.
                				
                				
                				
                					The self-same pulse of wonder shook like flame
                					The spirit of sense within me: what strange law
                					Had bid this be, for blessing or for blame?
                				
                				
                					To what veiled end that fate or chance foresaw
                					Came forth this second sister face, that came
                					Absolute, perfect, fair without a flaw,
                					Again the same?
                				
                			
                			  
                				III 
                				VENICE
                				
                					Out of the dark pure twilight, where the stream
                					Flows glimmering, streaked by many a birdlike bark
                					That skims the gloom whence towers and bridges gleam
                					Out of the dark,
                				
                				
                					Once more a face no glance might choose but mark
                					Shone pale and bright, with eyes whose deep slow beam
                					Made quick the twilight, lifeless else and stark.
                				
                				
                					The same it seemed, or mystery made it seem,
                					As those before beholden; but St. Mark
                					Ruled here the ways that showed it like a dream
                					Out of the dark.
