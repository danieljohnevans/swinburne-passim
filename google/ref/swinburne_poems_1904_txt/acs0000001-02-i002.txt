				Between the green bud and the red
				Youth sat and sang by Time, and shed
				From eyes and tresses flowers and tears,
				From heart and spirit hopes and fears,
				Upon the hollow stream whose bed
				Is channelled by the foamless years;
				And with the white the gold-haired head
				Mixed running locks, and in Time's ears
				Youth's dreams hung singing, and Time's truth
				Was half not harsh in the ears of Youth.
			
			
				Between the bud and the blown flower
				Youth talked with joy and grief an hour,
				With footless joy and wingless grief
				And twin-born faith and disbelief
				Who share the seasons to devour;
				And long ere these made up their sheaf
				Felt the winds round him shake and shower
				The rose-red and the blood-red leaf,
				Delight whose germ grew never grain,
				And passion dyed in its own pain.
			
			
				Then he stood up, and trod to dust
				Fear and desire, mistrust and trust,
				And dreams of bitter sleep and sweet,
				And bound for sandals on his feet
				
				Knowledge and patience of what must
				And what things may be, in the heat
				And cold of years that rot and rust
				And alter; and his spirit's meat
				Was freedom, and his staff was wrought
				Of strength, and his cloak woven of thought.
			
			
				For what has he whose will sees clear
				To do with doubt and faith and fear,
				Swift hopes and slow despondencies?
				His heart is equal with the sea's
				And with the sea-wind's, and his ear
				Is level to the speech of these,
				And his soul communes and takes cheer
				With the actual earth's equalities,
				Air, light, and night, hills, winds, and streams,
				And seeks not strength from strengthless dreams.
			
			
				His soul is even with the sun
				Whose spirit and whose eye are one,
				Who seeks not stars by day, nor light
				And heavy heat of day by night.
				Him can no God cast down, whom none
				Can lift in hope beyond the height
				Of fate and nature and things done
				By the calm rule of might and right
				That bids men be and bear and do,
				And die beneath blind skies or blue.
			
			
				To him the lights of even and morn
				Speak no vain things of love or scorn,
				Fancies and passions miscreate
				By man in things dispassionate.
				
				Nor holds he fellowship forlorn
				With souls that pray and hope and hate,
				And doubt they had better not been born,
				And fain would lure or scare off fate
				And charm their doomsman from their doom
				And make fear dig its own false tomb.
			
			
				He builds not half of doubts and half
				Of dreams his own soul's cenotaph,
				Whence hopes and fears with helpless eyes,
				Wrapt loose in cast-off cerecloths, rise
				And dance and wring their hands and laugh,
				And weep thin tears and sigh light sighs,
				And without living lips would quaff
				The living spring in man that lies,
				And drain his soul of faith and strength
				It might have lived on a life's length.
			
			
				He hath given himself and hath not sold
				To God for heaven or man for gold,
				Or grief for comfort that it gives,
				Or joy for grief's restoratives.
				He hath given himself to time, whose fold
				Shuts in the mortal flock that lives
				On its plain pasture's heat and cold
				And the equal year's alternatives.
				Earth, heaven, and time, death, life, and he,
				Endure while they shall be to be.
			
			
				“Yet between death and life are hours
				To flush with love and hide in flowers;
				What profit save in these?” men cry:
				“Ah, see, between soft earth and sky,
				
				What only good things here are ours!”
				They say, “what better wouldst thou try,
				What sweeter sing of? or what powers
				Serve, that will give thee ere thou die
				More joy to sing and be less sad,
				More heart to play and grow more glad?”
			
			
				Play then and sing; we too have played,
				We likewise, in that subtle shade.
				We too have twisted through our hair
				Such tendrils as the wild Loves wear,
				And heard what mirth the Mænads made,
				Till the wind blew our garlands bare
				And left their roses disarrayed,
				And smote the summer with strange air,
				And disengirdled and discrowned
				The limbs and locks that vine-wreaths bound.
			
			
				We too have tracked by star-proof trees
				The tempest of the Thyiades
				Scare the loud night on hills that hid
				The blood-feasts of the Bassarid,
				Heard their song's iron cadences
				Fright the wolf hungering from the kid,
				Outroar the lion-throated seas,
				Outchide the north-wind if it chid,
				And hush the torrent-tongued ravines
				With thunders of their tambourines.
			
			
				But the fierce flute whose notes acclaim
				Dim goddesses of fiery fame,
				Cymbal and clamorous kettledrum,
				Timbrels and tabrets, all are dumb
				
				That turned the high chill air to flame;
				The singing tongues of fire are numb
				That called on Cotys by her name
				Edonian, till they felt her come
				And maddened, and her mystic face
				Lightened along the streams of Thrace.
			
			
				For Pleasure slumberless and pale,
				And Passion with rejected veil,
				Pass, and the tempest-footed throng
				Of hours that follow them with song
				Till their feet flag and voices fail,
				And lips that were so loud so long
				Learn silence, or a wearier wail;
				So keen is change, and time so strong,
				To weave the robes of life and rend
				And weave again till life have end.
			
			
				But weak is change, but strengthless time,
				To take the light from heaven, or climb
				The hills of heaven with wasting feet.
				Songs they can stop that earth found meet,
				But the stars keep their ageless rhyme;
				Flowers they can slay that spring thought sweet,
				But the stars keep their spring sublime;
				Passions and pleasures can defeat,
				Actions and agonies control,
				And life and death, but not the soul.
			
			
				Because man's soul is man's God still,
				What wind soever waft his will
				Across the waves of day and night
				To port or shipwreck, left or right,
				
				By shores and shoals of good and ill;
				And still its flame at mainmast height
				Through the rent air that foam-flakes fill
				Sustains the indomitable light
				Whence only man hath strength to steer
				Or helm to handle without fear.
			
			
				Save his own soul's light overhead,
				None leads him, and none ever led,
				Across birth's hidden harbour-bar,
				Past youth where shoreward shallows are,
				Through age that drives on toward the red
				Vast void of sunset hailed from far,
				To the equal waters of the dead;
				Save his own soul he hath no star,
				And sinks, except his own soul guide,
				Helmless in middle turn of tide.
			
			
				No blast of air or fire of sun
				Puts out the light whereby we run
				With girded loins our lamplit race,
				And each from each takes heart of grace
				And spirit till his turn be done,
				And light of face from each man's face
				In whom the light of trust is one;
				Since only souls that keep their place
				By their own light, and watch things roll,
				And stand, have light for any soul.
			
			
				A little time we gain from time
				To set our seasons in some chime,
				For harsh or sweet or loud or low,
				With seasons played out long ago
				
				And souls that in their time and prime
				Took part with summer or with snow,
				Lived abject lives out or sublime,
				And had their chance of seed to sow
				For service or disservice done
				To those days dead and this their son.
			
			
				A little time that we may fill
				Or with such good works or such ill
				As loose the bonds or make them strong
				Wherein all manhood suffers wrong.
				By rose-hung river and light-foot rill
				There are who rest not; who think long
				Till they discern as from a hill
				At the sun's hour of morning song,
				Known of souls only, and those souls free,
				The sacred spaces of the sea.
