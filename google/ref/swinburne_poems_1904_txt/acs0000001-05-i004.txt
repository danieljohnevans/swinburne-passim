			To Joseph Mazzini
			
				
					
						
							Primâ dicte mihi, summâ dicende Camenâ
						
					
				
			
			
				1
			
				The shadows fallen of years are nine
				Since heaven grew seven times more divine
				With thy soul entering, and the dearth
				Of souls on earth
				Grew sevenfold sadder, wanting One
				Whose light of life, quenched here and done,
				Burns there eternal as the sun.
			
			
			
				2
			
				Beyond all word, beyond all deed,
				Beyond all thought beloved, what need
				Has death or love that speech should be,
				Hast thou of me?
				I had no word, no prayer, no cry,
				To praise or hail or mourn thee by,
				As when thou too wast man as I.
			
			
			
			
				3
			
				Nay, never, nor as any born
				Save one whose name priests turn to scorn,
				Who haply, though we know not now,
				Was man as thou,
				A wanderer branded with men's blame,
				Loved past man's utterance: yea, the same,
				Perchance, and as his name thy name.
			
			
			
				4
			
				Thou wast as very Christ—not he
				Degraded into Deity,
				And priest-polluted by such prayer
				As poisons air,
				Tongue-worship of the tongue that slays,
				False faith and parricidal praise:
				But the man crowned with suffering days.
			
			
			
				5
			
				God only, being of all mankind
				Most manlike, of most equal mind
				And heart most perfect, more than can
				Be heart of man
				Once in ten ages, born to be
				As haply Christ was, and as we
				Knew surely, seeing, and worshipped thee.
			
			
			
				6
			
				To know thee—this at least was ours,
				God, clothed upon with human hours,
				O face beloved, O spirit adored,
				Saviour and lord!
				
				That wast not only for thine own
				Redeemer—not of these alone
				But all to whom thy word was known.
			
			
			
				7
			
				Ten years have wrought their will with me
				Since last my words took wing for thee
				Who then wast even as now above
				Me, and my love.
				As then thou knewest not scorn, so now
				With that beloved benignant brow
				Take these of him whose light wast thou.
