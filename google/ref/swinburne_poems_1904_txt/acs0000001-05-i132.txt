        				Said a poet to a woodlouse—Thou art certainly my brother;
        				
        				I discern in thee the markings of the fingers of the Whole;
        				And I recognize, in spite of all the terrene smut and smother,
        				In the colours shaded off thee, the suggestions of a soul.
        			
        			
        				Yea, the poet said, I smell thee by some passive divination,
        				I am satisfied with insight of the measure of thine house;
        				What had happened I conjecture, in a blank and rhythmic passion,
        				Had the æons thought of making thee a man, and me a louse.
        			
        			
        				The broad lives of upper planets, their absorption and digestion,
        				Food and famine, health and sickness, I can scrutinize and test;
        				Through a shiver of the senses comes a resonance of question,
        				And by proof of balanced answer I decide that I am best.
        			
        			
        			
        				Man, the fleshly marvel, alway feels a certain kind of awe stick
        				To the skirts of contemplation, cramped with nympholeptic weight:
        				Feels his faint sense charred and branded by the touch of solar caustic,
        				On the forehead of his spirit feels the footprint of a Fate.
        			
        			
        				Notwithstanding which, O poet, spake the woodlouse, very blandly,
        				I am likewise the created,—I the equipoise of thee;
        				I the particle, the atom, I behold on either hand lie
        				The inane of measured ages that were embryos of me.
        			
        			
        				I am fed with intimations, I am clothed with consequences,
        				And the air I breathe is coloured with apocalyptic blush:
        				Ripest-budded odours blossom out of dim chaotic stenches,
        				And the Soul plants spirit-lilies in sick leagues of human slush.
        			
        			
        				I am thrilled half cosmically through by cryptophantic surgings,
        				Till the rhythmic hills roar silent through a spongious kind of blee:
        				And earth's soul yawns disembowelled of her pancreatic organs,
        				Like a madrepore if mesmerized, in rapt catalepsy.
        			
        			
        			
        				And I sacrifice, a Levite—and I palpitate, a poet;—
        				Can I close dead ears against the rush and resonance of things?
        				Symbols in me breathe and flicker up the heights of the heroic;
        				Earth's worst spawn, you said, and cursed me? look! approve me! I have wings.
        			
        			
        				Ah, men's poets! men's conventions crust you round and swathe you mist-like,
        				And the world's wheels grind your spirits down the dust ye overtrod:
        				We stand sinlessly stark-naked in effulgence of the Christlight,
        				And our polecat chokes not cherubs; and our skunk smells sweet to God.
        			
        			
        				For He grasps the pale Created by some thousand vital handles,
        				Till a Godshine, bluely winnowed through the sieve of thunderstorms,
        				Shimmers up the non-existent round the churning feet of angels;
        				And the atoms of that glory may be seraphs, being worms.
        			
        			
        				Friends, your nature underlies us and your pulses overplay us;
        				Ye, with social sores unbandaged, can ye sing right and steer wrong?
        				For the transient cosmic, rooted in imperishable chaos,
        				Must be kneaded into drastics as material for a song.
        			
        			
        			
        				Eyes once purged from homebred vapours through humanitarian passion
        				See that monochrome a despot through a democratic prism;
        				Hands that rip the soul up, reeking from divine evisceration,
        				Not with priestlike oil anoint him, but a stronger-smelling chrism.
        			
        			
        				Pass, O poet, retransfigured! God, the psychometric rhapsode,
        				Fills with fiery rhythms the silence, stings the dark with stars that blink;
        				All eternities hang round him like an old man's clothes collapsèd,
        				While he makes his mundane music—and he will not stop, I think.
