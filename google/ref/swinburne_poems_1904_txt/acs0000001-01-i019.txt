                Till death have broken
                Sweet life’s love-token,
                Till all be spoken
                That shall be said,
                What dost thou praying,
                O soul, and playing
                With song and saying,
                Things flown and fled?
                For this we know not —
                That fresh springs flow not
                And fresh griefs grow not
                When men are dead;
                When strange years cover
                Lover and lover,
                And joys are over
                And tears are shed.
            
            
                If one day’s sorrow
                Mar the day’s morrow —
                If man’s life borrow
                And man’s death pay —
                If souls once taken,
                If lives once shaken,
                Arise, awaken,
                By night, by day —
                
                Why with strong crying
                And years of sighing,
                Living and dying,
                Fast ye and pray?
                For all your weeping,
                Waking and sleeping,
                Death comes to reaping
                And takes away.
            
            
                Though time rend after
                Roof-tree from rafter,
                A little laughter
                Is much more worth
                Than thus to measure
                The hour, the treasure,
                The pain, the pleasure,
                The death, the birth;
                Grief, when days alter,
                Like joy shall falter;
                Song-book and psalter,
                Mourning and mirth.
                Live like the swallow;
                Seek not to follow
                Where earth is hollow
                Under the earth.
