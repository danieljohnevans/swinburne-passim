                				Low lies the mere beneath the moorside, still
                				And glad of silence: down the wood sweeps clear
                				To the utmost verge where fed with many a rill
                				Low lies the mere.
                			
                			
                				The wind speaks only summer: eye nor ear
                				Sees aught at all of dark, hears aught of shrill,
                				From sound or shadow felt or fancied here.
                			
                			
                				Strange, as we praise the dead man's might and skill,
                				Strange that harsh thoughts should make such heavy cheer,
                				While, clothed with peace by heaven's most gentle will,
                				Low lies the mere.
