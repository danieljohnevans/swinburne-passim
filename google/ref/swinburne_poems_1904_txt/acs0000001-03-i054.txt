                Take heed of this small child of earth;
                He is great: he hath in him God most high.
                Children before their fleshly birth
                Are lights alive in the blue sky.
            
            
                In our light bitter world of wrong
                They come; God gives us them awhile.
                His speech is in their stammering tongue,
                And his forgiveness in their smile.
            
            
                Their sweet light rests upon our eyes.
                Alas! their right to joy is plain.
                If they are hungry, Paradise
                Weeps, and, if cold, Heaven thrills with pain.
            
            
                The want that saps their sinless flower
                Speaks judgment on sin's ministers.
                Man holds an angel in his power.
                Ah! deep in Heaven what thunder stirs,
            
            
                When God seeks out these tender things
                Whom in the shadow where we sleep
                He sends us clothed about with wings,
                And finds them ragged babes that weep!
