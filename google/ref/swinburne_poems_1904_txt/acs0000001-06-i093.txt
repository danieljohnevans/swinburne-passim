                Et Judas m'a dit: Traître!—Victor Hugo
            
            
                I
                
                    Truths change with time, and terms with truth. To-day
                    
                    A statesman worships union, and to-night
                    Disunion. Shame to have sinned against the light
                    Confounds not but impels his tongue to unsay
                    What yestereve he swore. Should fear make way
                    For treason? honour change her livery? fright
                    Clasp hands with interest? wrong pledge faith with right?
                    Religion, mercy, conscience, answer—Yea.
                
                
                    To veer is not to veer: when votes are weighed,
                    The numerous tongue approves him renegade
                    Who cannot change his banner: he that can
                    Sits crowned with wreaths of praise too pure to fade.
                    Truth smiles applause on treason's poisonous plan:
                    And Cleon is an honourable man.
                
            
            
                II
                
                    Pure faith, fond hope, sweet love, with God for guide,
                    Move now the men whose blameless error cast
                    In prison (ah, but love condones the past!)
                    Their subject knaves that were—their lords that ride
                    
                    Now laughing on their necks, and now bestride
                    Their vassal backs in triumph. Faith stands fast
                    Though fear haul down the flag that crowned her mast
                    And hope and love proclaim that truth has lied.
                
                
                    Turn, turn, and turn—so bids the still small voice,
                    The changeless voice of honour. He that stands
                    Where all his life he stood, with bribeless hands,
                    With tongue unhired to mourn, reprove, rejoice,
                    Curse, bless, forswear, and swear again, and lie,
                    Stands proven apostate in the apostate's eye.
                
            
            
                III
                
                Fraud shrinks from faith: at sight of swans, the raven
                Chides blackness, and the snake recoils aghast
                In fear of poison when a bird flies past.
                Thersites brands Achilles as a craven;
                The shoal fed full with shipwreck blames the haven
                For murderous lust of lives devoured, and vast
                Desire of doom whose feast is mercy's fast:
                And Bacon sees the traitor's mark engraven
                Full on the front of Essex. Grief and shame
                Obscure the chaste and sunlike spirit of Oates
                At thought of Russell's treason; and the name
                Of Milton sickens with superb disgust
                The heaving heart of Waller. Wisdom dotes,
                If wisdom turns not tail and licks not dust.
                
            
            
                IV
                
                The sole sweet land found fit to wed the sea,
                With reptile rebels at her heel of old,
                Set hard her heel upon them, and controlled
                The cowering poisonous peril. How should she
                
                Cower, and resign her trust of empire? Free
                As winds and waters live the loyal-souled
                And true-born sons that love her: nay, the bold
                Base knaves who curse her name have leave to be
                The loud-tongued liars they are. For she, beyond
                All woful years that bid men's hearts despond,
                Sees yet the likeness of her ancient fame
                Burn from the heavenward heights of history, hears
                Not Leicester's name but Sidney's—faith's, not fear's—
                Not Gladstone's now but only Gordon's name.
