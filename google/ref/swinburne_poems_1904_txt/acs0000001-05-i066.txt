                				Fly, white butterflies, out to sea,
                				Frail pale wings for the winds to try,
                				Small white wings that we scarce can see
                				Fly.
                			
                			
                				Here and there may a chance-caught eye
                				Note in a score of you twain or three
                				Brighter or darker of tinge or dye.
                			
                			
                				Some fly light as a laugh of glee,
                				Some fly soft as a low long sigh:
                				All to the haven where each would be
                				Fly.
