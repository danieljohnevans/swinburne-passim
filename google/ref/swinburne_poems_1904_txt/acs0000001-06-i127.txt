                The sea that is life everlasting
                
                And death everlasting as life
                Abides not a pilot's forecasting,
                Foretells not of peace or of strife.
                The might of the night that was hidden
                Arises and darkens the day,
                A glory rebuked and forbidden,
                Time's crown, and his prey.
            
            
                No sweeter, no kindlier, no fairer,
                No lovelier a soul from its birth
                Wore ever a brighter and rarer
                Life's raiment for life upon earth
                Than his who enkindled and cherished
                Art's vestal and luminous flame,
                That dies not when kingdoms have perished
                In storm or in shame.
            
            
                No braver, no trustier, no purer,
                No stronger and clearer a soul
                Bore witness more splendid and surer
                For manhood found perfect and whole
                Since man was a warrior and dreamer
                Than his who in hatred of wrong
                Would fain have arisen a redeemer
                By sword or by song.
            
            
            
                Twin brethren in spirit, immortal
                As art and as love, which were one
                For you from the birthday whose portal
                First gave you to sight of the sun,
                To-day nor to-night nor to-morrow
                May bring you again from above,
                Drawn down by the spell of the sorrow
                Whose anguish is love.
            
            
                No light rearising hereafter
                Shall lighten us here as of old
                When seasons were lustrous as laughter
                Of waves that are snowshine and gold.
                The dawn that imbues and enkindles
                Life's fluctuant and fugitive sea
                Dies down as the starshine that dwindles
                And cares not to be.
            
            
                Men, mightier than death which divides us,
                Friends, dearer than sorrow can say,
                The light that is darkness and hides us
                Awhile from each other away
                Abides but awhile and endures not,
                We know, though the day be as night,
                For souls that forgetfulness lures not
                Till sleep be in sight.
            
            
                The sleep that enfolds you, the slumber
                Supreme and eternal on earth,
                Whence ages of numberless number
                Shall bring us not back into birth,
                We know not indeed if it be not
                What no man hath known if it be,
                Life, quickened with light that we see not
                If spirits may see.
            
            
            
                The love that would see and would know it
                Is even as the love of a child.
                But the fire of the fame of the poet
                Who gazed on the past, and it smiled,
                But the light of the fame of the painter
                Whose hand was as morning's in May,
                Death bids not be darker or fainter,
                Time casts not away.
            
            
                We, left of them loveless and lonely,
                Who lived in the light of their love,
                Whose darkness desires it, we only,
                Who see them afar and above,
                So far, if we die not, above us,
                So lately no dearer than near,
                May know not of death if they love us,
                Of night if they hear.
            
            
                We, stricken and darkling and living,
                Who loved them and love them, abide
                A day, and the gift of its giving,
                An hour, and the turn of its tide,
                When twilight and midnight and morrow
                Shall pass from the sight of the sun,
                And death be forgotten, and sorrow
                Discrowned and undone.
            
            
                For us as for these will the breathless
                Brief minute arise and pass by:
                And if death be not utterly deathless,
                If love do not utterly die,
                From the life that is quenched as an ember
                The soul that aspires as a flame
                Can choose not but wholly remember
                Love, lovelier than fame.
            
            
            
                Though sure be the seal of their glory
                And fairer no fame upon earth,
                Though never a leaf shall grow hoary
                Of the crowns that were given them at birth,
                While time as a vassal doth duty
                To names that he towers not above,
                More perfect in price and in beauty
                For ever is love.
            
            
                The night is upon us, and anguish
                Of longing that yearns for the dead.
                But mourners that faint not or languish,
                That veil not and bow not the head,
                Take comfort to heart if a token
                Be given them of comfort to be:
                While darkness on earth is unbroken,
                Light lives on the sea.
