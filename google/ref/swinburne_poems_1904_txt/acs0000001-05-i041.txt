                				Child of two strong nations, heir
                				Born of high-souled hope that smiled,
                				Seeing for each brought forth a fair
                				Child,
                			
                			
                				By thy gracious brows, and wild
                				Golden-clouded heaven of hair,
                				By thine eyes elate and mild,
                			
                			
                				Hope would fain take heart to swear
                				Men should yet be reconciled,
                				Seeing the sign she bids thee bear,
                				Child.
