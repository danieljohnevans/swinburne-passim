                When their last hour shall rise
                Pale on these mortal eyes,
                Herself like one that dies,
                And kiss me dying
                The cold last kiss, and fold
                Close round my limbs her cold
                Soft shade as raiment rolled
                And leave them lying,
            
            
                If aught my soul would say
                Might move to hear me pray
                The birth-god of my day
                That he might hearken,
                This grace my heart should crave,
                To find no landward grave
                That worldly springs make brave,
                World's winters darken,
            
            
                Nor grow through gradual hours
                The cold blind seed of flowers
                Made by new beams and showers
                From limbs that moulder,
                Nor take my part with earth,
                But find for death's new birth
                A bed of larger girth,
                More chaste and colder.
            
            
            
                Not earth's for spring and fall,
                Not earth's at heart, not all
                Earth's making, though men call
                Earth only mother,
                Not hers at heart she bare
                Me, but thy child, O fair
                Sea, and thy brother's care,
                The wind thy brother.
            
            
                Yours was I born, and ye,
                The sea-wind and the sea,
                Made all my soul in me
                A song for ever,
                A harp to string and smite
                For love's sake of the bright
                Wind and the sea's delight,
                To fail them never:
            
            
                Not while on this side death
                I hear what either saith
                And drink of either's breath
                With heart's thanksgiving
                That in my veins like wine
                Some sharp salt blood of thine,
                Some springtide pulse of brine,
                Yet leaps up living.
            
            
                When thy salt lips wellnigh
                Sucked in my mouth's last sigh,
                Grudged I so much to die
                This death as others?
                Was it no ease to think
                The chalice from whose brink
                Fate gave me death to drink
                Was thineâ€”my mother's?
            
            
            
                Thee too, the all-fostering earth,
                Fair as thy fairest birth,
                More than thy worthiest worth,
                We call, we know thee,
                More sweet and just and dread
                Than live men highest of head
                Or even thy holiest dead
                Laid low below thee.
            
            
                The sunbeam on the sheaf,
                The dewfall on the leaf,
                All joy, all grace, all grief,
                Are thine for giving;
                Of thee our loves are born,
                Our lives and loves, that mourn
                And triumph; tares with corn,
                Dead seed with living:
            
            
                All good and ill things done
                In eyeshot of the sun
                At last in thee made one
                Rest well contented;
                All words of all man's breath
                And works he doth or saith,
                All wholly done to death,
                None long lamented.
            
            
                A slave to sons of thee,
                Thou, seeming, yet art free:
                But who shall make the sea
                Serve even in seeming?
                What plough shall bid it bear
                Seed to the sun and the air,
                Fruit for thy strong sons' fare,
                Fresh wine's foam streaming?
            
            
            
                What oldworld son of thine,
                Made drunk with death as wine,
                Hath drunk the bright sea's brine
                With lips of laughter?
                Thy blood they drink; but he
                Who hath drunken of the sea
                Once deeplier than of thee
                Shall drink not after.
            
            
                Of thee thy sons of men
                Drink deep, and thirst again;
                For wine in feasts, and then
                In fields for slaughter;
                But thirst shall touch not him
                Who hath felt with sense grown dim
                Rise, covering lip and limb,
                The wan sea's water.
            
            
                All fire of thirst that aches
                The salt sea cools and slakes
                More than all springs or lakes,
                Freshets or shallows;
                Wells where no beam can burn
                Through frondage of the fern
                That hides from hart and hern
                The haunt it hallows.
            
            
                Peace with all graves on earth
                For death or sleep or birth
                Be alway, one in worth
                One with another;
                But when my time shall be,
                O mother, O my sea,
                Alive or dead, take me,
                Me too, my mother.
