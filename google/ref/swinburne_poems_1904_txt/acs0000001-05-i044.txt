                				What shall be done for sorrow
                				With love whose race is run?
                				Where help is none to borrow,
                				What shall be done?
                			
                			
                				In vain his hands have spun
                				The web, or drawn the furrow:
                				No rest their toil hath won.
                			
                			
                				His task is all gone thorough
                				And fruit thereof is none:
                				And who dare say to-morrow
                				What shall be done?
