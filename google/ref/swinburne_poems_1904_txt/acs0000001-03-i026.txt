                Love laid his sleepless head
                On a thorny rosy bed;
                And his eyes with tears were red,
                And pale his lips as the dead.
            
            
                And fear and sorrow and scorn
                Kept watch by his head forlorn,
                Till the night was overworn
                And the world was merry with morn.
            
            
                And Joy came up with the day
                And kissed Love's lips as he lay,
                And the watchers ghostly and grey
                Sped from his pillow away.
            
            
                And his eyes as the dawn grew bright,
                And his lips waxed ruddy as light:
                Sorrow may reign for a night,
                But day shall bring back delight.
