                    Had I wist, when life was like a warm wind playing
                    Light and loud through sundawn and the dew's bright mist,
                    How the time should come for hearts to sigh in saying
                    Had I wistâ€”
                
                
                    Surely not the roses, laughing as they kissed,
                    Not the lovelier laugh of seas in sunshine swaying,
                    Should have lured my soul to look thereon and list.
                
                
                    Now the wind is like a soul cast out and praying
                    Vainly, prayers that pierce not ears when hearts resist:
                    Now mine own soul sighs, adrift as wind and straying,
                    Had I wist.
