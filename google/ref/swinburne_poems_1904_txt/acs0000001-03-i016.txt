            (James Lorimer Graham died at Florence, April 30, 1876)
            
                Life may give for love to death
                Little; what are life's gifts worth
                To the dead wrapt round with earth?
                Yet from lips of living breath
                Sighs or words we are fain to give,
                All that yet, while yet we live,
                Life may give for love to death.
            
            
                Dead so long before his day,
                Passed out of the Italian sun
                To the dark where all is done,
                Fallen upon the verge of May;
                Here at life's and April's end
                How should song salute my friend
                Dead so long before his day?
            
            
                Not a kindlier life or sweeter
                Time, that lights and quenches men,
                Now may quench or light again,
                Mingling with the mystic metre
                Woven of all men's lives with his
                Not a clearer note than this,
                Not a kindlier life or sweeter.
            
            
            
                In this heavenliest part of earth
                He that living loved the light,
                Light and song, may rest aright,
                One in death, if strange in birth,
                With the deathless dead that make
                Life the lovelier for their sake
                In this heavenliest part of earth.
            
            
                Light, and song, and sleep at lastâ€”
                Struggling hands and suppliant knees
                Get no goodlier gift than these.
                Song that holds remembrance fast,
                Light that lightens death, attend
                Round their graves who have to friend
                Light, and song, and sleep at last.
