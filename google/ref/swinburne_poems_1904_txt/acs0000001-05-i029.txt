                				Soul within sense, immeasurable, obscure,
                				Insepulchred and deathless, through the dense
                				Deep elements may scarce be felt as pure
                				Soul within sense.
                			
                			
                				From depth and height by measurers left immense,
                				Through sound and shape and colour, comes the unsure
                				Vague utterance, fitful with supreme suspense.
                			
                			
                				All that may pass, and all that must endure,
                				Song speaks not, painting shows not: more intense
                				And keen than these, art wakes with music's lure
                				Soul within sense.
