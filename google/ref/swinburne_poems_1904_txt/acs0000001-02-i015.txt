				I
			
				Fire out of heaven, a flower of perfect fire,
				That where the roots of life are had its root
				And where the fruits of time are brought forth fruit;
				A faith made flesh, a visible desire,
				That heard the yet unbreathing years respire
				And speech break forth of centuries that sit mute
				Beyond all feebler footprint of pursuit;
				That touched the highest of hope, and went up higher;
				A heart love-wounded whereto love was law,
				A soul reproachless without fear or flaw,
				A shining spirit without shadow of shame,
				A memory made of all men's love and awe;
				Being disembodied, so thou be the same,
				What need, O soul, to sign thee with thy name?
			
			
			
				II
			
				All woes of all men sat upon thy soul
				And all their wrongs were heavy on thy head;
				With all their wounds thy heart was pierced and bled,
				And in thy spirit as in a mourning scroll
				
				The world's huge sorrows were inscribed by roll,
				All theirs on earth who serve and faint for bread,
				All banished men's, all theirs in prison dead,
				Thy love had heart and sword-hand for the whole.
				“This was my day of glory,” didst thou say,
				When, by the scaffold thou hadst hope to climb
				For thy faith's sake, they brought thee respite; “Nay,
				I shall not die then, I have missed my day.”
				O hero, O our help, O head sublime,
				Thy day shall be commensurate with time.
