                Far off is the sea, and the land is afar:
                
                The low banks reach at the sky,
                Seen hence, and are heavenward high;
                Though light for the leap of a boy they are,
                And the far sea late was nigh.
            
            
                The fair wild fields and the circling downs,
                The bright sweet marshes and meads
                All glorious with flowerlike weeds,
                The great grey churches, the sea-washed towns,
                Recede as a dream recedes.
            
            
                The world draws back, and the world's light wanes,
                As a dream dies down and is dead;
                And the clouds and the gleams overhead
                Change, and change; and the sea remains,
                A shadow of dreamlike dread.
            
            
                Wild, and woful, and pale, and grey,
                A shadow of sleepless fear,
                A corpse with the night for bier,
                The fairest thing that beholds the day
                Lies haggard and hopeless here.
            
            
            
                And the wind's wings, broken and spent, subside;
                And the dumb waste world is hoar,
                And strange as the sea the shore;
                And shadows of shapeless dreams abide
                Where life may abide no more.
            
            
                A sail to seaward, a sound from shoreward,
                And the spell were broken that seems
                To reign in a world of dreams
                Where vainly the dreamer's feet make forward
                And vainly the low sky gleams.
            
            
                The sea-forsaken forlorn deep-wrinkled
                Salt slanting stretches of sand
                That slope to the seaward hand,
                Were they fain of the ripples that flashed and twinkled
                And laughed as they struck the strand?
            
            
                As bells on the reins of the fairies ring
                The ripples that kissed them rang,
                The light from the sundawn sprang,
                And the sweetest of songs that the world may sing
                Was theirs when the full sea sang.
            
            
                Now no light is in heaven; and now
                Not a note of the sea-wind's tune
                Rings hither: the bleak sky's boon
                Grants hardly sight of a grey sun's browâ€”
                A sun more sad than the moon.
            
            
                More sad than a moon that clouds beleaguer
                And storm is a scourge to smite,
                The sick sun's shadowlike light
                Grows faint as the clouds and the waves wax eager,
                And withers away from sight.
            
            
            
                The day's heart cowers, and the night's heart quickens:
                Full fain would the day be dead
                And the stark night reign in his stead:
                The sea falls dumb as the sea-fog thickens
                And the sunset dies for dread.
            
            
                Outside of the range of time, whose breath
                Is keen as the manslayer's knife
                And his peace but a truce for strife,
                Who knows if haply the shadow of death
                May be not the light of life?
            
            
                For the storm and the rain and the darkness borrow
                But an hour from the suns to be,
                But a strange swift passage, that we
                May rejoice, who have mourned not to-day, to-morrow,
                In the sun and the wind and the sea.
