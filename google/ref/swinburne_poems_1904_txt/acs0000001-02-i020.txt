			To Joseph Mazzini
			
			
				
					Send the stars light, but send not love to me.
					
						Shelley.
					
				
			
			
				1
			
				Out of the dawning heavens that hear
				Young wings and feet of the new year
				Move through their twilight, and shed round
				Soft showers of sound,
				Soothing the season with sweet rain,
				If greeting come to make me fain,
				What is it I can send again?
			
			
			
				2
			
				I know not if the year shall send
				Tidings to usward as a friend,
				And salutation, and such things
				Bear on his wings
				As the soul turns and thirsts unto
				With hungering eyes and lips that sue
				For that sweet food which makes all new.
			
			
			
				3
			
				I know not if his light shall be
				Darkness, or else light verily:
				
				I know but that it will not part
				Heart's faith from heart,
				Truth from the trust in truth, nor hope
				From sight of days unscaled that ope
				Beyond one poor year's horoscope.
			
			
			
				4
			
				That faith in love which love's self gives,
				O master of my spirit, lives,
				Having in presence unremoved
				Thine head beloved,
				The shadow of thee, the semitone
				Of thy voice heard at heart and known,
				The light of thee not set nor flown.
			
			
			
				5
			
				Seas, lands, and hours, can these divide
				Love from love's service, side from side,
				Though no sound pass nor breath be heard
				Of one good word?
				To send back words of trust to thee
				Were to send wings to love, when he
				With his own strong wings covers me.
			
			
			
				6
			
				Who shall teach singing to the spheres,
				Or motion to the flight of years?
				Let soul with soul keep hand in hand
				And understand,
				As in one same abiding-place
				We keep one watch for one same face
				To rise in some short sacred space.
			
			
			
			
				7
			
				And all space midway is but nought
				To keep true heart from faithful thought,
				As under twilight stars we wait
				By Time's shut gate
				Till the slow soundless hinges turn,
				And through the depth of years that yearn
				The face of the Republic burn.
			
			
			
				
					1870.
