            Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
            
                Above the spring-tide sundawn of the year,
                A sunlike star, not born of day or night,
                Filled the fair heaven of spring with heavenlier light,
                Made of all ages orbed in one sole sphere
                Whose light was as a Titan's smile or tear;
                Then rose a ray more flowerlike, starry white,
                Like a child's eye grown lovelier with delight,
                Sweet as a child's heart-lightening laugh to hear;
                And last a fire from heaven, a fiery rain
                As of God's wrath on the unclean cities, fell
                And lit the shuddering shades of half-seen hell
                That shrank before it and were cloven in twain;
                A beacon fired by lightning, whence all time
                Sees red the bare black ruins of a crime.
