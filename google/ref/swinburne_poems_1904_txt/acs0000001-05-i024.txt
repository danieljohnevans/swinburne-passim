                I
                
                    Dead and gone, the days we had together,
                    Shadow-stricken all the lights that shone
                    Round them, flown as flies the blown foam's feather,
                    Dead and gone.
                
                
                    Where we went, we twain, in time foregone,
                    Forth by land and sea, and cared not whether,
                    If I go again, I go alone.
                
                
                    Bound am I with time as with a tether;
                    Thee perchance death leads enfranchised on,
                    Far from deathlike life and changeful weather,
                    Dead and gone.
                
            
            
                II
                
                    Above the sea and sea-washed town we dwelt,
                    We twain together, two brief summers, free
                    From heed of hours as light as clouds that melt
                    Above the sea.
                
                
                    Free from all heed of aught at all were we,
                    Save chance of change that clouds or sunbeams dealt
                    And gleam of heaven to windward or to lee.
                
            	
                
                    The Norman downs with bright grey waves for belt
                    Were more for us than inland ways might be;
                    A clearer sense of nearer heaven was felt
                    Above the sea.
                
            
            
                III
                
                    Cliffs and downs and headlands which the forward-hasting
                    Flight of dawn and eve empurples and embrowns,
                    Wings of wild sea-winds and stormy seasons wasting
                    Cliffs and downs,
                
                
                    These, or ever man was, were: the same sky frowns,
                    Laughs, and lightens, as before his soul, forecasting
                    Times to be, conceived such hopes as time discrowns.
                
                
                    These we loved of old: but now for me the blasting
                    Breath of death makes dull the bright small seaward towns,
                    Clothes with human change these all but everlasting
                    Cliffs and downs.
