                				I
                				
                					Eros, from rest in isles far-famed,
                					With rising Anthesterion rose,
                					And all Hellenic heights acclaimed
                					Eros.
                				
                				
                					The sea one pearl, the shore one rose,
                					All round him all the flower-month flamed
                					And lightened, laughing off repose.
                				
                				
                					Earth's heart, sublime and unashamed,
                					Knew, even perchance as man's heart knows,
                					The thirst of all men's nature named
                					Eros.
                				
                			
                			
                				II
                				
                					Eros, a fire of heart untamed,
                					A light of spirit in sense that glows,
                					Flamed heavenward still ere earth defamed
                					Eros.
                				
                				
                					Nor fear nor shame durst curb or close
                					His golden godhead, marred and maimed,
                					Fast round with bonds that burnt and froze.
                				
                				
                				
                					Ere evil faith struck blind and lamed
                					Love, pure as fire or flowers or snows,
                					Earth hailed as blameless and unblamed
                					Eros.
                				
                			
                			
                				III
                				
                					Eros, with shafts by thousands aimed
                					At laughing lovers round in rows,
                					Fades from their sight whose tongues proclaimed
                					Eros.
                				
                				
                					But higher than transient shapes or shows
                					The light of love in life inflamed
                					Springs, toward no goal that these disclose.
                				
                				
                					Above those heavens which passion claimed
                					Shines, veiled by change that ebbs and flows,
                					The soul in all things born or framed,
                					Eros.
