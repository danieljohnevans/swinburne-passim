                As a vesture shalt thou change them, said the prophet,
                
                And the raiment that was flesh is turned to dust;
                Dust and flesh and dust again the likeness of it,
                And the fine gold woven and worn of youth is rust.
                Hours that wax and wane salute the shade and scoff it,
                That it knows not aught it doth nor aught it must:
                Day by day the speeding soul makes haste to doff it,
                Night by night the pride of life resigns its trust.
            
            
                Sleep, whose silent notes of song loud life's derange not,
                Takes the trust in hand awhile as angels may:
                Joy with wings that rest not, grief with wings that range not,
                Guard the gates of sleep and waking, gold or grey.
                Joys that joys estrange, and griefs that griefs estrange not,
                Day that yearns for night, and night that yearns for day,
                As a vesture shalt thou change them, and they change not,
                Seeing that change may never change or pass away.
            
            
            
                Life of death makes question,What art thou that changest?
                What am I, that fear should trust or faith should doubt?
                I that lighten, thou that darkenest and estrangest,
                Is it night or day that girds us round about?
                Light and darkness on the ways wherein thou rangest
                Seem as one, and beams as clouds they put to rout.
                Strange is hope, but fear of all things born were strangest,
                Seeing that none may strive with change to cast it out.
            
            
                Change alone stands fast, thou sayest, O death: I know not:
                What art thou, my brother death, that thou shouldst know?
                Men may reap no fruits of fields wherein they sow not;
                Hope or fear is all the seed we have to sow.
                Winter seals the sacred springs up that they flow not:
                Wind and sun and change unbind them, and they flow.
                Am I thou or art thou I? The years that show not
                Pass, and leave no sign when time shall be to show.
            
            
                Hope makes suit to faith lest fear give ear to sorrow:
                Doubt strews dust upon his head, and goes his way.
                All the golden hope that life of death would borrow,
                How, if death require again, may life repay?
                
                Earth endures no darkness whence no light yearns thorough;
                God in man as light in darkness lives, they say:
                Yet, would midnight take assurance of the morrow,
                Who shall pledge the faith or seal the bond of day?
            
            
                Darkness, mute or loud with music or with mourning,
                Starry darkness, winged with wind or clothed with calm,
                Dreams no dream of grief or fear or wrath or warning,
                Bears no sign of race or goal or strife or palm.
                Word of blessing, word of mocking or of scorning,
                Knows it none, nor whence its breath sheds blight or balm.
                Yet a little while, and hark, the psalm of morning:
                Yet a little while, and silence takes the psalm.
            
            
                All the comfort, all the worship, all the wonder,
                All the light of love that darkness holds in fee,
                All the song that silence keeps or keeps not under,
                Night, the soul that knows gives thanks for all to thee.
                Far beyond the gates that morning strikes in sunder,
                Hopes that grief makes holy, dreams that fear sets free,
                Far above the throne of thought, the lair of thunder,
                Silent shines the word whose utterance fills the sea.
