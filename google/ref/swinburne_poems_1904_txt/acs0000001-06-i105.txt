                The wave that breaks against a forward stroke
                Beats not the swimmer back, but thrills him through
                With joyous trust to win his way anew
                Through stronger seas than first upon him broke
                And triumphed. England's iron-tempered oak
                Shrank not when Europe's might against her grew
                Full, and her sun drank up her foes like dew,
                And lion-like from sleep her strength awoke.
            
            
                As bold in fight as bold in breach of trust
                We find our foes, and wonder not to find,
                Nor grudge them praise whom honour may not bind:
                But loathing more intense than speaks disgust
                Heaves England's heart, when scorn is bound to greet
                Hunters and hounds whose tongues would lick their feet.
            
            November 1, 1899.
