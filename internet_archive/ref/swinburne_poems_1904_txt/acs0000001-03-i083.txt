                New Year, be good to England. Bid her name
                Shine sunlike as of old on all the sea:
                Make strong her soul: set all her spirit free:
                Bind fast her homeborn foes with links of shame
                More strong than iron and more keen than flame:
                Seal up their lips for shame's sake: so shall she
                Who was the light that lightened freedom be,
                For all false tongues, in all men's eyes the same.
            
            
                O last-born child of Time, earth's eldest lord,
                God undiscrowned of godhead, who for man
                Begets all good and evil things that live,
                Do thou, his new-begotten son, implored
                Of hearts that hope and fear not, make thy span
                Bright with such light as history bids thee give.
            
            
                Jan. 1, 1889.
