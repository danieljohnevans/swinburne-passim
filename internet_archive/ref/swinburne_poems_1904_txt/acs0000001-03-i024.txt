                Now the days are all gone over
                Of our singing, love by lover,
                Days of summer-coloured seas
                Blown adrift through beam and breeze.
            
            
                Now the nights are all past over
                Of our dreaming, dreams that hover
                In a mist of fair false things,
                Nights afloat on wide wan wings.
            
            
                Now the loves with faith for mother,
                Now the fears with hope for brother,
                Scarce are with us as strange words,
                Notes from songs of last year's birds.
            
            
                Now all good that comes or goes is
                As the smell of last year's roses,
                As the radiance in our eyes
                Shot from summer's ere he dies.
            
            
                Now the morning faintlier risen
                Seems no God come forth of prison,
                But a bird of plume-plucked wing,
                Pale with thoughts of evening.
            
            
            
                Now hath hope, outraced in running,
                Given the torch up of his cunning
                And the palm he thought to wear
                Even to his own strong childâ€”despair.
