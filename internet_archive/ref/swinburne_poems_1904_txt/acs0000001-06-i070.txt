				                1893
				                
				                    The sea of the years that endure not
				                    Whose tide shall endure till we die
				                    And know what the seasons assure not,
				                    If death be or life be a lie,
				                    Sways hither the spirit and thither,
				                    A waif in the swing of the sea
				                    Whose wrecks are of memories that wither
				                    As leaves of a tree.
				                
				                
				                    We hear not and hail not with greeting
				                    The sound of the wings of the years,
				                    The storm of the sound of them beating,
				                    That none till it pass from him hears:
				                    But tempest nor calm can imperil
				                    The treasures that fade not or fly;
				                    Change bids them not change and be sterile,
				                    Death bids them not die.
				                
				                
				                    Hearts plighted in youth to the royal
				                    High service of hope and of song,
				                    Sealed fast for endurance as loyal,
				                    And proved of the years as they throng,
				                    
				                    Conceive not, believe not, and fear not
				                    That age may be other than youth;
				                    That faith and that friendship may hear not
				                    And utter not truth.
				                
				                
				                    Not yesterday's light nor to-morrow's
				                    Gleams nearer or clearer than gleams,
				                    Though joys be forgotten and sorrows
				                    Forgotten as changes of dreams,
				                    The dawn of the days unforgotten
				                    That noon could eclipse not or slay,
				                    Whose fruits were as children begotten
				                    Of dawn upon day.
				                
				                
				                    The years that were flowerful and fruitless,
				                    The years that were fruitful and dark,
				                    The hopes that were radiant and rootless,
				                    The hopes that were winged for their mark,
				                    Lie soft in the sepulchres fashioned
				                    Of hours that arise and subside,
				                    Absorbed and subdued and impassioned,
				                    In pain or in pride.
				                
				                
				                    But far in the night that entombs them
				                    The starshine as sunshine is strong,
				                    And clear through the cloud that resumes them
				                    Remembrance, a light and a song,
				                    Rings lustrous as music and hovers
				                    As birds that impend on the sea,
				                    And thoughts that their prison-house covers
				                    Arise and are free.
				                
				                
				                    Forgetfulness deep as a prison
				                    Holds days that are dead for us fast
				                    
				                    Till the sepulchre sees rearisen
				                    The spirit whose reign is the past,
				                    Disentrammelled of darkness, and kindled
				                    With life that is mightier than death,
				                    When the life that obscured it has dwindled
				                    And passed as a breath.
				                
				                
				                    But time nor oblivion may darken
				                    Remembrance whose name will be joy
				                    While memory forgets not to hearken,
				                    While manhood forgets not the boy
				                    Who heard and exulted in hearing
				                    The songs of the sunrise of youth
				                    Ring radiant above him, unfearing
				                    And joyous as truth.
				                
				                
				                    Truth, winged and enkindled with rapture
				                    And sense of the radiance of yore,
				                    Fulfilled you with power to recapture
				                    What never might singer beforeâ€”
				                    The life, the delight, and the sorrow
				                    Of troublous and chivalrous years
				                    That knew not of night or of morrow,
				                    Of hopes or of fears.
				                
				                
				                    But wider the wing and the vision
				                    That quicken the spirit have spread
				                    Since memory beheld with derision
				                    Man's hope to be more than his dead.
				                    From the mists and the snows and the thunders
				                    Your spirit has brought for us forth
				                    Light, music, and joy in the wonders
				                    And charms of the north.
				                
				                
				                
				                    The wars and the woes and the glories
				                    That quicken and lighten and rain
				                    From the clouds of its chronicled stories,
				                    The passion, the pride, and the pain,
				                    Whose echoes were mute and the token
				                    Was lost of the spells that they spake,
				                    Rise bright at your bidding, unbroken
				                    Of ages that break.
				                
				                
				                    For you, and for none of us other,
				                    Time is not: the dead that must live
				                    Hold commune with you as a brother
				                    By grace of the life that you give.
				                    The heart that was in them is in you,
				                    Their soul in your spirit endures:
				                    The strength of their song is the sinew
				                    Of this that is yours.
				                
				                
				                    Hence is it that life, everlasting
				                    As light and as music, abides
				                    In the sound of the surge of it, casting
				                    Sound back to the surge of the tides,
				                    Till sons of the sons of the Norsemen
				                    Watch, hurtling to windward and lee,
				                    Round England, unbacked of her horsemen,
				                    The steeds of the sea.
