            to
            Christina G. Rossetti
            
                Songs light as these may sound, though deep and strong
                The heart spake through them, scarce should hope to please
                Ears tuned to strains of loftier thoughts than throng
                Songs light as these.
            
            
                Yet grace may set their sometime doubt at ease,
                Nor need their too rash reverence fear to wrong
                The shrine it serves at and the hope it sees.
            
            
                For childlike loves and laughters thence prolong
                Notes that bid enter, fearless as the breeze,
                Even to the shrine of holiest-hearted song,
                Songs light as these.
