                Sweet heart, that no taint of the throne or the stage
                Could touch with unclean transformation, or alter
                To the likeness of courtiers whose consciences falter
                At the smile or the frown, at the mirth or the rage,
                Of a master whom chance could inflame or assuage,
                Our Lady of Laughter, invoked in no psalter,
                Adored of no faithful that cringe and that palter,
                Praise be with thee yet from a hag-ridden age.
            
            
                Our Lady of Pity thou wast: and to thee
                All England, whose sons are the sons of the sea,
                Gives thanks, and will hear not if history snarls
                When the name of the friend of her sailors is spoken;
                And thy lover she cannot but loveâ€”by the token
                That thy name was the last on the lips of King Charles.
