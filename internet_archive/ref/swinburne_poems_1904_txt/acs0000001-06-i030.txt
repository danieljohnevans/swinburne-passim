            ASTROPHEL
             AFTER READING SIR PHILIP SIDNEY'S ARCADIA IN THE GARDEN OF AN OLD ENGLISH MANOR HOUSE 
            
                I
                
                    A star in the silence that follows
                    The song of the death of the song
                    Speaks music in heaven, and the hollows
                    And heights of the world are as one;
                    One lyre that outsings and outlightens
                    The rapture of sunset and thrills
                    Mute night till the sense of it brightens
                    The star that it fills.
                

                
                    The folowers of the sun that is sunken.
                    Hang heavy of heart as of head;
                    The bees that have eaten and drunken
                    The soul of their sweetness are fled;
                    But a sunflower of song, on whose honey
                    My spirit has fed as a bee.
                    Makes sunnier than morning: was sunny
                    The twilight for me.
                

                
                    The letters and lines on the pages.
                    That sundered mine eyes and the flowers
                


                
                
                    Wax faint as the shadows of ages
                    That sunder their season and ours;
                    As the ghosts of the centuries that sever
                    A season of colourless time
                    From the days whose remembrance is ever,
                    As they were, sublime.
                

                
                    The season that bred that cherished
                    The soul that I commune with yet,
                    Had it utterly withered and perished
                    To rise not again as it set,
                    Shame were it that Englishmen living
                    Should read as their forefathers read
                    The books of the praise and thanksgiving
                    Of Englishmen dead.
                

                
                    O light of the land that adored thee
                    And kindled thy soul with her breath,
                    Whose life, such as fate would afford thee,
                    Was lovelier than aught but thy death,
                    By what name, could thy lovers but know it,
                    Might love of thee hail thee afar,
                    Philisides, Astrophel, poet
                    Whose love was thy star?
                

                
                    A star in the moondawn of Maytime,
                    A star in the cloudland of change;
                    Too splendid and sad for the daytime
                    To cheer or eclipse or estrange;
                    Too sweet for tradition or vision
                    To see but through shadows of tears
                    Rise deathless across the division
                    Of measureless years.
                

                

                
                    The twilight may deepen and harden
                    As nightward the streets of it runs
                    Till starshine transfigure a garden
                    Whose radiance responds to the sun's;
                    The light of the love of thee darkens
                    The lights that arise and that set:
                    The love that forgets thee not hearkens
                    If England forget.
                
            
            
                II

                
                    Bright and brief in the sight of grief and love the light of thy lifetime shone,
                    Seen and felt by the gifts it dealt, the grace it gave, and again was gone:
                    Ay, but now it is death, not thou, whom time has conquered as years pass on.
                

                
                    Ay, not yet may the land forget that bore and loved thee and praised and wept,
                    Sidney, lord of the stainless sword, the name of names that her heart's love kept
                    Fast as thine did her own, a sign to light thy love till it sank and slept.
                

                
                    Bright as then for the souls of men thy brave Arcadia resounds and shines,
                    Lit with love that beholds above all joys and sorrows the steadfast signs,
                    Faith, a splendour that hope makes tender, and truth, whose presage the soul divines.
                

                
                    All the glory that girds the story of all thy life as with sunlight round,
                

                
                
                    All the spell that on all souls fell who saw thy spirit, and held them bound,
                    Lives for all that have heard the call and cadence yet of its music sound.
                

                
                    Music bright as the soul of light, for wings an eagle, for notes a dove,
                    Leaps and shines from the lustrous lines whereâ€”through thy soul from afar above
                    Shone and sang till the darkness rang with light whose fire is the fount of love.
                

                
                    Love that led thee alive, and fed thy soul with sorrows and joys and fears,
                    Love that sped thee, alive and dead, to fame's fair goal with thy peerless peers,
                    Feeds the flame of thy quenchless name with light that lightens the rayless years.
                

                
                    Dark as sorrow through night and morrow may lower with presage of clouded fame,
                    How may she that of old bare thee, may Sidney's England, be brought to shame?
                    How should this be, while England is? What need of answer beyond thy name?
                
            

            
                III

                
                    From the love that transfigures thy glory,
                    From the light of the dawn of thy death,
                    The life of thy song and thy story
                    Took subtler and fierier breath.
                

                

                
                    And we, though the day and the morrow
                    Set fear and thanksgiving at strife,
                    Hail yet in the star of thy sorrow
                    The sun of thy life.
                

                
                    Shame and fear may beset men here, and bid thanksgiving and pride be dumb:
                    Faith, discrowned of her praise, and wound about
                    with toils till her life wax numb,
                    Scarce may see if the sundawn be, if darkness die
                    not and dyrise come.
                

                
                    But England, enmeshed and benetted,
                    With spiritless villanies round,
                    With counsels of cowardice fretted,
                    With trammels of treason enwound,
                    Is yet, though the season be other
                    Than wept and rejoiced over thee,
                    Thine England, thy lover, thy mother,
                    Sublime as the sea.
                

                
                    Hers wast thou: if her face be now less bright, or
                    seem for an hour less brave,
                    Let but thine on her darkness shine, thy savour
                    spirit revive and save,
                    Time shall see, as the shadows flee, her shame
                    entombed in a shameful grave.
                

                
                    If death and not life were the portal
                    That opens on life at the last,
                    If the spirit of Sidney were mortal
                    And the past of it utterly past,
                

                

                
                    Fear stronger than honour was ever,
                    Forgetfulness mightier than fame,
                    Fame knows not if England should never
                    Subside into shame.
                

                
                    Yea, but yet is thy sun not set, thy sunbright spirit
                    of trust withdrawn:
                    England's love of thee burns above all hopes that
                    darken or fears that fawn:
                    Hers thou art: and the faithful heart that hopes
                    begets upon darkness dawn.
                

                
                    The sunset that sunrise will follow
                    Is less than the dream of a dream:
                    The starshine on height and on hollow
                    Sheds promise that dawn shall redeem:
                    The night, if the daytime would hide it,
                    Shows lovelier, aflame and afar,
                    Thy soul and thy Stella's beside it,
                    A star by a star.
