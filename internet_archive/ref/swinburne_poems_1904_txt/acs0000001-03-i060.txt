            1878
            
                Some nine years gone, as we dwelt together
                In the sweet hushed heat of the south French weather
                Ere autumn fell on the vine-tressed hills
                Or the season had shed one rose-red feather,
            
            
                Friend, whose fame is a flame that fills
                All eyes it lightens and hearts it thrills
                With joy to be born of the blood which bred
                From a land that the grey sea girds and chills
            
            
                The heart and spirit and hand and head
                Whose might is as light on a dark day shed,
                On a day now dark as a land's decline
                Where all the peers of your praise are dead,
            
            
                In a land and season of corn and vine
                I pledged you a health from a beaker of mine
                But halfway filled to the lip's edge yet
                With hope for honey and song for wine.
            
            
            
                Nine years have risen and eight years set
                Since there by the wellspring our hands on it met:
                And the pledge of my songs that were then to be,
                I could wonder not, friend, though a friend should forget.
            
            
                For life's helm rocks to the windward and lee,
                And time is as wind, and as waves are we;
                And song is as foam that the sea-winds fret,
                Though the thought at its heart should be deep as the sea.
