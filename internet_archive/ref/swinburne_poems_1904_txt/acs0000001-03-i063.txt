            1887

            
                I
                Eight hundred years and twenty-one
                Have shone and sunken since the land
                Whose name is freedom bore such brand
                As marks a captive, and the sun
                Beheld her fettered hand.
            
            
                II
                But ere dark time had shed as rain
                Or sown on sterile earth as seed
                That bears no fruit save tare and weed
                An age and half an age again,
                She rose on Runnymede.
            
            
                III
                Out of the shadow, starlike still,
                She rose up radiant in her right,
                And spake, and put to fear and flight
                The lawless rule of awless will
                That pleads no right save might.
            
            
            
                IV
                Nor since hath England ever borne
                The burden laid on subject lands,
                The rule that curbs and binds all hands
                Save one, and marks for servile scorn
                The heads it bows and brands.
            
            
                V
                A commonweal arrayed and crowned
                With gold and purple, girt with steel
                At need, that foes must fear or feel,
                We find her, as our fathers found,
                Earth's lordliest commonweal.
            
            
                VI
                And now that fifty years are flown
                Since in a maiden's hand the sign
                Of empire that no seas confine
                First as a star to seaward shone,
                We see their record shine.
            
            
                VII
                A troubled record, foul and fair,
                A simple record and serene,
                Inscribes for praise a blameless queen,
                For praise and blame an age of care
                And change and ends unseen.
            
            
            
                VIII
                Hope, wide of eye and wild of wing,
                Rose with the sundawn of a reign
                Whose grace should make the rough ways plain,
                And fill the worn old world with spring,
                And heal its heart of pain.
            
            
                IX
                Peace was to be on earth; men's hope
                Was holier than their fathers had,
                Their wisdom not more wise than glad:
                They saw the gates of promise ope,
                And heard what love's lips bade.
            
            
                X
                Love armed with knowledge, winged and wise,
                Should hush the wind of war, and see,
                They said, the sun of days to be
                Bring round beneath serener skies
                A stormless jubilee.
            
            
                XI
                Time, in the darkness unbeholden
                That hides him from the sight of fear
                And lets but dreaming hope draw near,
                Smiled and was sad to hear such golden
                Strains hail the all-golden year.
            
            
            
                XII
                Strange clouds have risen between, and wild
                Red stars of storm that lit the abyss
                Wherein fierce fraud and violence kiss
                And mock such promise as beguiled
                The fiftieth year from this.
            
            
                XIII
                War upon war, change after change,
                Hath shaken thrones and towers to dust,
                And hopes austere and faiths august
                Have watched in patience stern and strange
                Men's works unjust and just.
            
            
                XIV
                As from some Alpine watch-tower's portal
                Night, living yet, looks forth for dawn,
                So from time's mistier mountain lawn
                The spirit of man, in trust immortal,
                Yearns toward a hope withdrawn.
            
            
                XV
                The morning comes not, yet the night
                Wanes, and men's eyes win strength to see
                Where twilight is, where light shall be
                When conquered wrong and conquering right
                Acclaim a world set free.
            
            
            
                XVI
                Calm as our mother-land, the mother
                Of faith and freedom, pure and wise,
                Keeps watch beneath unchangeful skies,
                When hath she watched the woes of other
                Strange lands with alien eyes?
            
            
                XVII
                Calm as she stands alone, what nation
                Hath lacked an alms from English hands?
                What exiles from what stricken lands
                Have lacked the shelter of the station
                Where higher than all she stands?
            
            
                XVIII
                Though time discrown and change dismantle
                The pride of thrones and towers that frown,
                How should they bring her glories downâ€”
                The sea cast round her like a mantle,
                The sea-cloud like a crown?
            
            
                XIX
                The sea, divine as heaven and deathless,
                Is hers, and none but only she
                Hath learnt the sea's word, none but we
                Her children hear in heart the breathless
                Bright watchword of the sea.
            
            
            
                XX
                Heard not of others, or misheard
                Of many a land for many a year,
                The watchword Freedom fails not here
                Of hearts that witness if the word
                Find faith in England's ear.
            
            
                XXI
                She, first to love the light, and daughter
                Incarnate of the northern dawn,
                She, round whose feet the wild waves fawn
                When all their wrath of warring water
                Sounds like a babe's breath drawn,
            
            
                XXII
                How should not she best know, love best,
                And best of all souls understand
                The very soul of freedom, scanned
                Far off, sought out in darkling quest
                By men at heart unmanned?
            
            
                XXIII
                They climb and fall, ensnared, enshrouded,
                By mists of words and toils they set
                To take themselves, till fierce regret
                Grows mad with shame, and all their clouded
                Red skies hang sunless yet.
            
            
            
                XXIV
                But us the sun, not wholly risen
                Nor equal now for all, illumes
                With more of light than cloud that looms;
                Of light that leads forth souls from prison
                And breaks the seals of tombs.
            
            
                XXV
                Did not her breasts who reared us rear
                Him who took heaven in hand, and weighed
                Bright world with world in balance laid?
                What Newton's might could make not clear
                Hath Darwin's might not made?
            
            
                XXVI
                The forces of the dark dissolve,
                The doorways of the dark are broken:
                The word that casts out night is spoken,
                And whence the springs of things evolve
                Light born of night bears token.
            
            
                XXVII
                She, loving light for light's sake only,
                And truth for only truth's, and song
                For song's sake and the sea's, how long
                Hath she not borne the world her lonely
                Witness of right and wrong?
            
            
            
                XXVIII
                From light to light her eyes imperial
                Turn, and require the further light,
                More perfect than the sun's in sight,
                Till star and sun seem all funereal
                Lamps of the vaulted night.
            
            
                XXIX
                She gazes till the strenuous soul
                Within the rapture of her eyes
                Creates or bids awake, arise,
                The light she looks for, pure and whole
                And worshipped of the wise.
            
            
                XXX
                Such sons are hers, such radiant hands
                Have borne abroad her lamp of old,
                Such mouths of honey-dropping gold
                Have sent across all seas and lands
                Her fame as music rolled.
            
            
                XXXI
                As music made of rolling thunder
                That hurls through heaven its heart sublime,
                Its heart of joy, in charging chime,
                So ring the songs that round and under
                Her temple surge and climb.
            
            
            
                XXXII
                A temple not by men's hands builded,
                But moulded of the spirit, and wrought
                Of passion and imperious thought;
                With light beyond all sunlight gilded,
                Whereby the sun seems nought.
            
            
                XXXIII
                Thy shrine, our mother, seen for fairer
                Than even thy natural face, made fair
                With kisses of thine April air
                Even now, when spring thy banner-bearer
                Took up thy sign to bear;
            
            
                XXXIV
                Thine annual sign from heaven's own arch
                Given of the sun's hand into thine,
                To rear and cheer each wildwood shrine
                But now laid waste by wild-winged March,
                March, mad with wind like wine.
            
            
                XXXV
                From all thy brightening downs whereon
                The windy seaward whin-flower shows
                Blossom whose pride strikes pale the rose
                Forth is the golden watchword gone
                Whereat the world's face glows.
            
            
            
                XXXVI
                Thy quickening woods rejoice and ring
                Till earth seems glorious as the sea:
                With yearning love too glad for glee
                The world's heart quivers toward the spring
                As all our hearts toward thee.
            
            
                XXXVII
                Thee, mother, thee, our queen, who givest
                Assurance to the heavens most high
                And earth whereon her bondsmen sigh
                That by the sea's grace while thou livest
                Hope shall not wholly die.
            
            
                XXXVIII
                That while thy free folk hold the van
                Of all men, and the sea-spray shed
                As dew more heavenly on thy head
                Keeps bright thy face in sight of man,
                Man's pride shall drop not dead.
            
            
                XXXIX
                A pride more pure than humblest prayer,
                More wise than wisdom born of doubt,
                Girds for thy sake men's hearts about
                With trust and triumph that despair
                And fear may cast not out.
            
            
            
                XL
                Despair may wring men's hearts, and fear
                Bow down their heads to kiss the dust,
                Where patriot memories rot and rust,
                And change makes faint a nation's cheer,
                And faith yields up her trust.
            
            
                XLI
                Not here this year have true men known,
                Not here this year may true men know,
                That brand of shame-compelling woe
                Which bids but brave men shrink or groan
                And lays but honour low.
            
            
                XLII
                The strong spring wind blows notes of praise,
                And hallowing pride of heart, and cheer
                Unchanging, toward all true men here
                Who hold the trust of ancient days
                High as of old this year.
            
            
                XLIII
                The days that made thee great are dead;
                The days that now must keep thee great
                Lie not in keeping of thy fate;
                In thine they lie, whose heart and head
                Sustain thy charge of state.
            
            
            
                XLIV
                No state so proud, no pride so just,
                The sun, through clouds at sunrise curled
                Or clouds across the sunset whirled,
                Hath sight of, nor has man such trust
                As thine in all the world.
            
            
                XLV
                Each hour that sees the sunset's crest
                Make bright thy shores ere day decline
                Sees dawn the sun on shores of thine,
                Sees west as east and east as west
                On thee their sovereign shine.
            
            
                XLVI
                The sea's own heart must needs wax proud
                To have borne the world a child like thee.
                What birth of earth might ever be
                Thy sister? Time, a wandering cloud,
                Is sunshine on thy sea.
            
            
                XLVII
                Change mars not her; and thee, our mother,
                What change that irks or moves thee mars?
                What shock that shakes? what chance that jars?
                Time gave thee, as he gave none other,
                A station like a star's.
            
            
            
                XLVIII
                The storm that shrieks, the wind that wages
                War with the wings of hopes that climb
                Too high toward heaven in doubt sublime,
                Assail not thee, approved of ages
                The towering crown of time.
            
            
                XLIX
                Toward thee this year thy children turning
                With souls uplift of changeless cheer
                Salute with love that casts out fear,
                With hearts for beacons round thee burning,
                The token of this year.
            
            
                L
                With just and sacred jubilation
                Let earth sound answer to the sea
                For witness, blown on winds as free,
                How England, how her crowning nation,
                Acclaims this jubilee.
