			A Study in Three Stages
			(On the Busts of Nero in the UffizjUffizi.) 
			
				I
				A child of brighter than the morning's birth
				And lovelier than all smiles that may be smiled
				Save only of little children undefiled,
				Sweet, perfect, witless of their own dear worth,
				Live rose of love, mute melody of mirth,
				Glad as a bird is when the woods are mild,
				Adorable as is nothing save a child,
				Hails with wide eyes and lips his life on earth,
				His lovely life with all its heaven to be.
				And whoso reads the name inscribed or hears
				Feels his own heart a frozen well of tears,
				Child, for deep dread and fearful pity of thee
				Whom God would not let rather die than see
				The incumbent horror of impending years.
			
			
				II
				Man, that wast godlike being a child, and now,
				No less than kinglike, art no more in sooth
				For all thy grace and lordliness of youth,
				The crown that bids men's branded foreheads bow
				
				Much more has branded and bowed down thy brow
				And gnawn upon it as with fire or tooth
				Of steel or snake so sorely, that the truth
				Seems here to bear false witness. Is it thou,
				Child? and is all the summer of all thy spring
				This? are the smiles that drew men's kisses down
				All faded and transfigured to the frown
				That grieves thy face? Art thou this weary thing?
				Then is no slave's load heavier than a crown
				And such a thrall no bondman as a king.
			
			
				III
				Misery, beyond all men's most miserable,
				Absolute, whole, defiant of defence,
				Inevitable, inexplacable, intense,
				More vast than heaven is high, more deep than hell,
				Past cure or charm of solace or of spell,
				Possesses and pervades the spirit and sense
				Whereto the expanse of the earth pays tribute; whence
				Breeds evil only, and broods on fumes that swell
				Rank from the blood of brother and mother and wife.
				Misery of miseries, all is misery, saith
				The heavy fair-faced hateful head, at strife
				With its own lusts that burn with feverous breath
				Lips which the loathsome bitterness of life
				Leaves fearful of the bitterness of death.
