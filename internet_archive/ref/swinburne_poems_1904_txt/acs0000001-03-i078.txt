                Return, they cry, ere yet your day
                Set, and the sky grow stern:
                Return, strayed souls, while yet ye may
                Return.
            
            
                But heavens beyond us yearn;
                Yea, heights of heaven above the sway
                Of stars that eyes discern.
            
            
                The soul whose wings from shoreward stray
                Makes toward her viewless bourne
                Though trustless faith and unfaith say,
                Return.
