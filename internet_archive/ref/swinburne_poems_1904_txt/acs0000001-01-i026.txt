                When the game began between them for a jest,
                He played king and she played queen to match the best;
                Laughter soft as tears, and tears that turned to laughter,
                These were things she sought for years and sorrowed after.
            
            
                Pleasure with dry lips, and pain that walks by night;
                All the sting and all the stain of long delight;
                These were things she knew not of, that knew not of her,
                When she played at half a love with half a lover.
            
            
                Time was chorus, gave them cues to laugh or cry;
                They would kill, befool, amuse him, let him die;
                Set him webs to weave to-day and break to-morrow,
                Till he died for good in play, and rose in sorrow.
            
            
                What the years mean; how time dies and is not slain;
                How love grows and laughs and cries and wanes again;
                These were things she came to know, and take their measure,
                When the play was played out so for one manâ€™s pleasure.
