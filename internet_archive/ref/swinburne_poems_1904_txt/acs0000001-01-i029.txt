                Kissing her hair I sat against her feet,
                Wove and unwove it, wound and found it sweet;
                Made fast therewith her hands, drew down her eyes,
                Deep as deep flowers and dreamy like dim skies;
                With her own tresses bound and found her fair,
                Kissing her hair.
            
            
                Sleep were no sweeter than her face to me,
                Sleep of cold sea-bloom under the cold sea;
                What pain could get between my face and hers?
                What new sweet thing would love not relish worse?
                Unless, perhaps, white death had kissed me there,
                Kissing her hair?
