				Here, down between the dusty trees,
				At this lank edge of haggard wood,
				Women with labour-loosened knees,
				With gaunt backs bowed by servitude,
				Stop, shift their loads, and pray, and fare
				Forth with souls easier for the prayer.
			
			
				The suns have branded black, the rains
				Striped grey this piteous God of theirs;
				The face is full of prayers and pains,
				To which they bring their pains and prayers;
				Lean limbs that shew the labouring bones,
				And ghastly mouth that gapes and groans.
			
			
				God of this grievous people, wrought
				After the likeness of their race,
				By faces like thine own besought,
				Thine own blind helpless eyeless face,
				I too, that have nor tongue nor knee
				For prayer, I have a word to thee.
			
			
				It was for this then, that thy speech
				Was blown about the world in flame
				And men's souls shot up out of reach
				Of fear or lust or thwarting shame —
				That thy faith over souls should pass
				As sea-winds burning the grey grass?
			
			
			
				It was for this, that prayers like these
				Should spend themselves about thy feet,
				And with hard overlaboured knees
				Kneeling, these slaves of men should beat
				Bosoms too lean to suckle sons
				And fruitless as their orisons?
			
			
				It was for this, that men should make
				Thy name a fetter on men's necks,
				Poor men's made poorer for thy sake,
				And women's withered out of sex?
				It was for this, that slaves should be,
				Thy word was passed to set men free?
			
			
				The nineteenth wave of the ages rolls
				Now deathward since thy death and birth.
				Hast thou fed full men's starved-out souls?
				Hast thou brought freedom upon earth?
				Or are there less oppressions done
				In this wild world under the sun?
			
			
				Nay, if indeed thou be not dead,
				Before thy terrene shrine be shaken,
				Look down, turn usward, bow thine head;
				O thou that wast of God forsaken,
				Look on thine household here, and see
				These that have not forsaken thee.
			
			
				Thy faith is fire upon their lips,
				Thy kingdom golden in their hand;
				They scourge us with thy words for whips,
				They brand us with thy words for brands;
				The thirst that made thy dry throat shrink
				To their moist mouths commends the drink.
			
			
			
				The toothèd thorns that bit thy brows
				Lighten the weight of gold on theirs;
				Thy nakedness enrobes thy spouse
				With the soft sanguine stuff she wears
				Whose old limbs use for ointment yet
				Thine agony and bloody sweat.
			
			
				The blinding buffets on thine head
				On their crowned heads confirm the crown;
				Thy scourging dyes their raiment red,
				And with thy bands they fasten down
				For burial in the blood-bought field
				The nations by thy stripes unhealed.
			
			
				With iron for thy linen bands
				And unclean cloths for winding-sheet
				They bind the people's nail-pierced hands,
				They hide the people's nail-pierced feet;
				And what man or what angel known
				Shall roll back the sepulchral stone?
			
			
				But these have not the rich man's grave
				To sleep in when their pain is done.
				These were not fit for God to save.
				As naked hell-fire is the sun
				In their eyes living, and when dead
				These have not where to lay their head.
			
			
				They have no tomb to dig, and hide;
				Earth is not theirs, that they should sleep.
				On all these tombless crucified
				No lovers' eyes have time to weep.
				So still, for all man's tears and creeds,
				The sacred body hangs and bleeds.
			
			
			
				Through the left hand a nail is driven,
				Faith, and another through the right,
				Forged in the fires of hell and heaven,
				Fear that puts out the eye of light:
				And the feet soiled and scarred and pale
				Are pierced with falsehood for a nail.
			
			
				And priests against the mouth divine
				Push their sponge full of poison yet
				And bitter blood for myrrh and wine,
				And on the same reed is it set
				Wherewith before they buffeted
				The people's disanointed head.
			
			
				O sacred head, O desecrate,
				O labour-wounded feet and hands,
				O blood poured forth in pledge to fate
				Of nameless lives in divers lands,
				O slain and spent and sacrificed
				People, the grey-grown speechless Christ!
			
			
				Is there a gospel in the red
				Old witness of thy wide-mouthed wounds?
				From thy blind stricken tongueless head
				What desolate evangel sounds
				A hopeless note of hope deferred?
				What word, if there be any word?
			
			
				O son of man, beneath man's feet
				Cast down, O common face of man
				Whereon all blows and buffets meet,
				O royal, O republican
				Face of the people bruised and dumb
				And longing till thy kingdom come!
			
			
			
				The soldiers and the high priests part
				Thy vesture: all thy days are priced,
				And all the nights that eat thine heart.
				And that one seamless coat of Christ,
				The freedom of the natural soul,
				They cast their lots for to keep whole.
			
			
				No fragment of it save the name
				They leave thee for a crown of scorns
				Wherewith to mock thy naked shame
				And forehead bitten through with thorns
				And, marked with sanguine sweat and tears,
				The stripes of eighteen hundred years.
			
			
				And we seek yet if God or man
				Can loosen thee as Lazarus,
				Bid thee rise up republican
				And save thyself and all of us;
				But no disciple's tongue can say
				When thou shalt take our sins away.
			
			
				And mouldering now and hoar with moss
				Between us and the sunlight swings
				The phantom of a Christless cross
				Shadowing the sheltered heads of kings
				And making with its moving shade
				The souls of harmless men afraid.
			
			
				It creaks and rocks to left and right
				Consumed of rottenness and rust,
				Worm-eaten of the worms of night,
				Dead as their spirits who put trust,
				Round its base muttering as they sit,
				In the time-cankered name of it.
			
			
			
				Thou, in the day that breaks thy prison,
				People, though these men take thy name,
				And hail and hymn thee rearisen,
				Who made songs erewhile of thy shame,
				Give thou not ear; for these are they
				Whose good day was thine evil day.
			
			
				Set not thine hand unto their cross.
				Give not thy soul up sacrificed.
				Change not the gold of faith for dross
				Of Christian creeds that spit on Christ.
				Let not thy tree of freedom be
				Regrafted from that rotting tree.
			
			
				This dead God here against my face
				Hath help for no man; who hath seen
				The good works of it, or such grace
				As thy grace in it, Nazarene,
				As that from thy live lips which ran
				For man's sake, O thou son of man?
			
			
				The tree of faith ingraffed by priests
				Puts its foul foliage out above thee,
				And round it feed man-eating beasts
				Because of whom we dare not love thee;
				Though hearts reach back and memories ache,
				We cannot praise thee for their sake.
			
			
				O hidden face of man, whereover
				The years have woven a viewless veil,
				If thou wast verily man's lover,
				What did thy love or blood avail?
				Thy blood the priests make poison of,
				And in gold shekels coin thy love.
			
			
			
				So when our souls look back to thee
				They sicken, seeing against thy side,
				Too foul to speak of or to see,
				The leprous likeness of a bride,
				Whose kissing lips through his lips grown
				Leave their God rotten to the bone.
			
			
				When we would see thee man, and know
				What heart thou hadst toward men indeed,
				Lo, thy blood-blackened altars; lo,
				The lips of priests that pray and feed
				While their own hell's worm curls and licks
				The poison of the crucifix.
			
			
				Thou bad'st let children come to thee;
				What children now but curses come?
				What manhood in that God can be
				Who sees their worship, and is dumb?
				No soul that lived, loved, wrought, and died,
				Is this their carrion crucified.
			
			
				Nay, if their God and thou be one,
				If thou and this thing be the same,
				Thou shouldst not look upon the sun;
				The sun grows haggard at thy name.
				Come down, be done with, cease, give o'er;
				Hide thyself, strive not, be no more.
