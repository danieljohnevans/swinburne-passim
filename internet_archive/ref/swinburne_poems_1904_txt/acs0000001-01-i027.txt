                Nothing is better, I well think,
                Than love; the hidden well-water
                Is not so delicate to drink:
                This was well seen of me and her.
            
            
                I served her in a royal house;
                I served her wine and curious meat.
                For will to kiss between her brows,
                I had no heart to sleep or eat.
            
            
                Mere scorn God knows she had of me,
                A poor scribe, nowise great or fair,
                Who plucked his clerk’s hood back to see
                Her curled-up lips and amorous hair.
            
            
                I vex my head with thinking this.
                Yea, though God always hated me,
                And hates me now that I can kiss
                Her eyes, plait up her hair to see
            
            
                How she then wore it on the brows,
                Yet am I glad to have her dead
                Here in this wretched wattled house
                Where I can kiss her eyes and head.
            
            
            
                Nothing is better, I well know,
                Than love; no amber in cold sea
                Or gathered berries under snow:
                That is well seen of her and me.
            
            
                Three thoughts I make my pleasure of:
                First I take heart and think of this:
                That knight’s gold hair she chose to love,
                His mouth she had such will to kiss.
            
            
                Then I remember that sundawn
                I brought him by a privy way
                Out at her lattice, and thereon
                What gracious words she found to say.
            
            
                (Cold rushes for such little feet —
                Both feet could lie into my hand.
                A marvel was it of my sweet
                Her upright body could so stand.)
            
            
                "Sweet friend, God give you thank and grace;
                Now am I clean and whole of shame,
                Nor shall men burn me in the face
                For my sweet fault that scandals them."
            
            
                I tell you over word by word.
                She, sitting edgewise on her bed,
                Holding her feet, said thus. The third,
                A sweeter thing than these, I said.
            
            
                God, that makes time and ruins it
                And alters not, abiding God,
                Changed with disease her body sweet,
                The body of love wherein she abode.
            
            
            
                Love is more sweet and comelier
                Than a dove’s throat strained out to sing.
                All they spat out and cursed at her
                And cast her forth for a base thing.
            
            
                They cursed her, seeing how God had wrought
                This curse to plague her, a curse of his.
                Fools were they surely, seeing not
                How sweeter than all sweet she is.
            
            
                He that had held her by the hair,
                With kissing lips blinding her eyes,
                Felt her bright bosom, strained and bare,
                Sigh under him, with short mad cries
            
            
                Out of her throat and sobbing mouth
                And body broken up with love,
                With sweet hot tears his lips were loth
                Her own should taste the savour of,
            
            
                Yea, he inside whose grasp all night
                Her fervent body leapt or lay,
                Stained with sharp kisses red and white,
                Found her a plague to spurn away.
            
            
                I hid her in this wattled house,
                I served her water and poor bread.
                For joy to kiss between her brows
                Time upon time I was nigh dead.
            
            
                Bread failed; we got but well-water
                And gathered grass with dropping seed.
                I had such joy of kissing her,
                I had small care to sleep or feed.
            
            
            
                Sometimes when service made me glad
                The sharp tears leapt between my lids,
                Falling on her, such joy I had
                To do the service God forbids.
            
            
                "I pray you let me be at peace,
                Get hence, make room for me to die."
                She said that: her poor lip would cease,
                Put up to mine, and turn to cry.
            
            
                I said, "Bethink yourself how love
                Fared in us twain, what either did;
                Shall I unclothe my soul thereof?
                That I should do this, God forbid."
            
            
                Yea, though God hateth us, he knows
                That hardly in a little thing
                Love faileth of the work it does
                Till it grow ripe for gathering.
            
            
                Six months, and now my sweet is dead
                A trouble takes me; I know not
                If all were done well, all well said,
                No word or tender deed forgot.
            
            
                Too sweet, for the least part in her,
                To have shed life out by fragments; yet,
                Could the close mouth catch breath and stir,
                I might see something I forget.
            
            
                Six months, and I sit still and hold
                In two cold palms her cold two feet.
                Her hair, half grey half ruined gold,
                Thrills me and burns me in kissing it.
            
            
            
                Love bites and stings me through, to see
                Her keen face made of sunken bones.
                Her worn-off eyelids madden me,
                That were shot through with purple once.
            
            
                She said, "Be good with me; I grow
                So tired for shame’s sake, I shall die
                If you say nothing:" even so.
                And she is dead now, and shame put by.
            
            
                Yea, and the scorn she had of me
                In the old time, doubtless vexed her then.
                I never should have kissed her. See
                What fools God’s anger makes of men!
            
            
                She might have loved me a little too,
                Had I been humbler for her sake.
                But that new shame could make love new
                She saw not — yet her shame did make.
            
            
                I took too much upon my love,
                Having for such mean service done
                Her beauty and all the ways thereof,
                Her face and all the sweet thereon.
            
            
                Yea, all this while I tended her,
                I know the old love held fast his part:
                I know the old scorn waxed heavier,
                Mixed with sad wonder, in her heart.
            
            
                It may be all my love went wrong —
                A scribe’s work writ awry and blurred,
                Scrawled after the blind evensong —
                Spoilt music with no perfect word.
            
            
            
                But surely I would fain have done
                All things the best I could. Perchance
                Because I failed, came short of one,
                She kept at heart that other man’s.
            
            
                I am grown blind with all these things:
                It may be now she hath in sight
                Some better knowledge; still there clings
                The old question. Will not God do right?
            
            
                    * En ce temps-là estoyt dans ce pays grand nombre de ladres et de meseaulx, ce dont le roy eut grand desplaisir, veu que Dieu dust en estre moult griefvement courroucé. Ores il advint qu’une noble damoyselle appelée Yolande de Sallières estant atteincte et touste guastée de ce vilain mal, tous ses amys et ses parens ayant devant leurs yeux la paour de Dieu la firent issir fors de leurs maisons et oncques ne voulurent recepvoir ni reconforter chose mauldicte de Dieu et à tous les hommes puante et abhominable. Ceste dame avoyt esté moult belle et gracieuse de formes, et de son corps elle estoyt large et de vie lascive. Pourtant nul des amans qui l’avoyent souventesfois accollée et baisée moult tendrement ne voulust plus héberger si laide femme et si détestable pescheresse. Ung seul clerc qui feut premièrement son lacquays et son entremetteur en matière d’amour la reçut chez luy et la récéla dans une petite cabane. Là mourut la meschinette de grande misère et de male mort: et après elle décéda ledist clerc qui pour grand amour l’avoyt six mois durant soignée, lavée, habillée et deshabillée tous les jours de ses mains propres. Mesme dist-on que ce meschant homme et mauldict clerc se remémourant de la grande beauté passée et guastée de ceste femme se délectoyt maintesfois à la baiser sur sa bouche orde et lépreuse et l’accoller doulcement de ses mains amoureuses. Aussy est-il mort de ceste mesme maladie abhominable. Cecy advint près Fontainebellant en Gastinois. Et quand ouyt le roy Philippe ceste adventure moult en estoyt esmerveillé.
