                Fair of face, full of pride,
                Sit ye down by a dead man's side.
            
            
                Ye sang songs a' the day:
                Sit down at night in the red worm's way.
            
            
                Proud ye were a' day long:
                Ye'll be but lean at evensong.
            
            
                Ye had gowd kells on your hair:
                Nae man kens what ye were.
            
            
                Ye set scorn by the silken stuff:
                Now the grave is clean enough.
            
            
                Ye set scorn by the rubis ring:
                Now the worm is a saft sweet thing.
            
            
                Fine gold and blithe fair face,
                Ye are come to a grimly place.
            
            
                Gold hair and glad grey een,
                Nae man kens if ye have been.
