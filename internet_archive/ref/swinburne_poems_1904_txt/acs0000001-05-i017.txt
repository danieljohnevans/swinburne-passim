                The wind's way in the deep sky's hollow
                None may measure, as none can say
                How the heart in her shows the swallow
                The wind's way.
            
            
                Hope nor fear can avail to stay
                Waves that whiten on wrecks that wallow,
                Times and seasons that wane and slay.
            
            
                Life and love, till the strong night swallow
                Thought and hope and the red last ray,
                Swim the waters of years that follow
                The wind's way.
