                Fire, and behind the breathless flight of fire
                Thunder that quickens fear and quells desire,
                Make bright and loud the terror of the night
                Wherein the soul sees only wrath for light.
                Wrath winged by love and sheathed by grief in steel
                Sets on the front of crime death's withering seal.
                The heaving horror of the storms of sin
                Brings forth in fear the lightning hid therein,
                And flashes back to darkness: truth, found pure
                And perfect, asks not heaven if shame endure.
                What life and death were his whose raging song
                Bore heaven such witness of the wild world's wrong,
                What hand was this that grasped such thunder, none
                Knows: night and storm seclude him from the sun.
                By daytime none discerns the fire of Mars:
                Deep darkness bares to sight the sterner stars,
                The lights whose dawn seems doomsday. None may tell
                Whence rose a world so lit from heaven and hell.
                Life-wasting love, hate born of raging lust,
                Fierce retribution, fed with death's own dust
                And sorrow's pampering poison, cross and meet,
                And wind the world in passion's winding-sheet.
                So, when dark faith in faith's dark ages heard
                Falsehood, and drank the poison of the Word,
                
                Two shades misshapen came to monstrous birth,
                A father fiend in heaven, a thrall on earth:
                Man, meanest born of beasts that press the sod,
                And die: the vilest of his creatures, God.
                A judge unjust, a slave that praised his name,
                Made life and death one fire of sin and shame.
                And thence reverberate even on Shakespeare's age
                A light like darkness crossed his sunbright stage.
                Music, sublime as storm or sorrow, sang
                Before it: tempest like a harpstring rang.
                The fiery shadow of a name unknown
                Rose, and in song's high heaven abides alone.
