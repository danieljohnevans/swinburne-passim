            From the French of the Vidame de Chartes
            12—?
              
                When the fieldfields catch flower
                And the underwood is green,
                And from bower unto bower
                The songs of the birds begin,
                I sing with sighing between.
                When I laugh and sing,
                I am heavy at heart for my sin;
                I am sad in the spring
                For my love that I shall not win,
                For a foolish thing.
            
              
                This profit I have of my woe,
                That I know, as I sing,
                I know he will needs have it so
                Who is master and king,
                Who is lord of the spirit of spring.
                I will serve her and will not spare
                Till her pity awake
                Who is good, who is pure, who is fair,
                Even her for whose sake
                Love hath ta’en me and slain unaware.
            
            
              
                O my lord, O Love,
                I have laid my life at thy feet;
                Have thy will thereof,
                Do as it please thee with it,
                For what shall please thee is sweet.
                I am come unto thee
                To do thee service, O Love;
                Yet cannot I see
                Thou wilt take any pity thereof,
                Any mercy on me.
            
              
                But the grace I have long time sought
                Comes never in sight,
                If in her it abideth not,
                Through thy mercy and might,
                Whose heart is the world’s delight.
                Thou hast sworn without fail I shall die,
                For my heart is set
                On what hurts me, I wot not why,
                But cannot forget
                What I love, what I sing for and sigh.
            
              
                She is worthy of praise,
                For this grief of her giving is worth
                All the joy of my days
                That lie between death’s day and birth,
                All the lordship of things upon earth.
                Nay, what have I said?
                I would not be glad if I could;
                My dream and my dread
                Are of her, and for her sake I would
                That my life were fled.
            
            
              
                Lo, sweet, if I durst not pray to you,
                Then were I dead;
                If I sang not a little to say to you,
                (Could it be said)
                O my love, how my heart would be fed;
                Ah sweet who hast hold of my heart,
                For thy love’s sake I live,
                Do but tell me, ere either depart,
                What a lover may give
                For a woman so fair as thou art.
            
              
                The lovers that disbelieve,
                False rumours shall grieve
                And evil-speaking shall part.
