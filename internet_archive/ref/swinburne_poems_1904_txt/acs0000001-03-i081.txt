                Fourscore and five times has the gradual year
                Risen and fulfilled its days of youth and eld
                Since first the child's eyes opening first beheld
                Light, who now leaves behind to help us here
                Light shed from song as starlight from a sphere
                Serene as summer; song whose charm compelled
                The sovereign soul made flesh in Artevelde
                To stand august before us and austere,
                Half sad with mortal knowledge, all sublime
                With trust that takes no taint from change or time,
                Trust in man's might of manhood. Strong and sage,
                Clothed round with reverence of remembering hearts,
                He, twin-born with our nigh departing age,
                Into the light of peace and fame departs.
