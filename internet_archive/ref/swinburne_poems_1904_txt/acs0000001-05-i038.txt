                				A little way, more soft and sweet
                				Than fields aflower with May,
                				A babe's feet, venturing, scarce complete
                				A little way.
                			
                			
                				Eyes full of dawning day
                				Look up for mother's eyes to meet,
                				Too blithe for song to say.
                			
                			
                				Glad as the golden spring to greet
                				Its first live leaflet's play,
                				Love, laughing, leads the little feet
                				A little way.
