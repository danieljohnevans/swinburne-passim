				A faint sea without wind or sun;
				A sky like flameless vapour dun;
				A valley like an unsealed grave
				That no man cares to weep upon,
				Bare, without boon to crave,
				Or flower to save.
			
			
				And on the lip's edge of the down,
				Here where the bent-grass burns to brown
				In the dry sea-wind, and the heath
				Crawls to the cliff-side and looks down,
				I watch, and hear beneath
				The low tide breathe.
			
			
				Along the long lines of the cliff,
				Down the flat sea-line without skiff
				Or sail or back-blown fume for mark,
				Through wind-worn heads of heath and stiff
				Stems blossomless and stark
				With dry sprays dark,
			
			
				I send mine eyes out as for news
				Of comfort that all these refuse,
				Tidings of light or living air
				From windward where the low clouds muse
				And the sea blind and bare
				Seems full of care.
			
			
			
				So is it now as it was then,
				And as men have been such are men.
				There as I stood I seem to stand,
				Here sitting chambered, and again
				Feel spread on either hand
				Sky, sea, and land.
			
			
				As a queen taken and stripped and bound
				Sat earth, discoloured and discrowned;
				As a king's palace empty and dead
				The sky was, without light or sound;
				And on the summer's head
				Were ashes shed.
			
			
				Scarce wind enough was on the sea,
				Scarce hope enough there moved in me,
				To sow with live blown flowers of white
				The green plain's sad serenity,
				Or with stray thoughts of light
				Touch my soul's sight.
			
			
				By footless ways and sterile went
				My thought unsatisfied, and bent
				With blank unspeculative eyes
				On the untracked sands of discontent
				Where, watched of helpless skies,
				Life hopeless lies.
			
			
				East and west went my soul to find
				Light, and the world was bare and blind
				And the soil herbless where she trod
				And saw men laughing scourge mankind,
				Unsmitten by the rod
				Of any God.
			
			
			
				Out of time's blind old eyes were shed
				Tears that were mortal, and left dead
				The heart and spirit of the years,
				And on man's fallen and helmless head
				Time's disanointing tears
				Fell cold as fears.
			
			
				Hope flowering had but strength to bear
				The fruitless fruitage of despair;
				Grief trod the grapes of joy for wine,
				Whereof love drinking unaware
				Died as one undivine
				And made no sign.
			
			
				And soul and body dwelt apart;
				And weary wisdom without heart
				Stared on the dead round heaven and sighed,
				“Is death too hollow as thou art,
				Or as man's living pride?”
				And saying so died.
			
			
				And my soul heard the songs and groans
				That are about and under thrones,
				And felt through all time's murmur thrill
				Fate's old imperious semitones
				That made of good and ill
				One same tune still.
			
			
				Then “Where is God? and where is aid?
				Or what good end of these?” she said;
				“Is there no God or end at all,
				Nor reason with unreason weighed,
				Nor force to disenthral
				Weak feet that fall?
			
			
			
				“No light to lighten and no rod
				To chasten men? Is there no God?”
				So girt with anguish, iron-zoned,
				Went my soul weeping as she trod
				Between the men enthroned
				And men that groaned.
			
			
				O fool, that for brute cries of wrong
				Heard not the grey glad mother's song
				Ring response from the hills and waves,
				But heard harsh noises all day long
				Of spirits that were slaves
				And dwelt in graves.
			
			
				The wise word of the secret earth
				Who knows what life and death are worth,
				And how no help and no control
				Can speed or stay things come to birth,
				Nor all worlds' wheels that roll
				Crush one born soul.
			
			
				With all her tongues of life and death,
				With all her bloom and blood and breath,
				From all years dead and all things done,
				In the ear of man the mother saith,
				“There is no God, O son,
				If thou be none.”
			
			
				So my soul sick with watching heard
				That day the wonder of that word,
				And as one springs out of a dream
				Sprang, and the stagnant wells were stirred
				Whence flows through gloom and gleam
				Thought's soundless stream.
			
			
			
				Out of pale cliff and sunburnt heath,
				Out of the low sea curled beneath
				In the land's bending arm embayed,
				Out of all lives that thought hears breathe
				Life within life inlaid,
				Was answer made.
			
			
				A multitudinous monotone
				Of dust and flower and seed and stone,
				In the deep sea-rock's mid-sea sloth,
				In the live water's trembling zone,
				In all men love and loathe,
				One God at growth.
			
			
				One forceful nature uncreate
				That feeds itself with death and fate,
				Evil and good, and change and time,
				That within all men lies at wait
				Till the hour shall bid them climb
				And live sublime.
			
			
				For all things come by fate to flower
				At their unconquerable hour,
				And time brings truth, and truth makes free,
				And freedom fills time's veins with power,
				As, brooding on that sea,
				My thought filled me.
			
			
				And the sun smote the clouds and slew,
				And from the sun the sea's breath blew,
				And white waves laughed and turned and fled
				The long green heaving sea-field through,
				And on them overhead
				The sky burnt red.
			
			
			
				Like a furled flag that wind sets free,
				On the swift summer-coloured sea
				Shook out the red lines of the light,
				The live sun's standard, blown to lee
				Across the live sea's white
				And green delight.
			
			
				And with divine triumphant awe
				My spirit moved within me saw,
				With burning passion of stretched eyes,
				Clear as the light's own firstborn law,
				In windless wastes of skies
				Time's deep dawn rise.
