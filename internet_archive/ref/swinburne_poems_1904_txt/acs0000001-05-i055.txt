                				Wind and sea and cloud and cloud-forsaking
                				Mirth of moonlight where the storm leaves free
                				Heaven awhile, for all the wrath of waking
                				Wind and sea.
                			
                			
                				Bright with glad mad rapture, fierce with glee,
                				Laughs the moon, borne on past cloud's o'ertaking
                				Fast, it seems, as wind or sail can flee.
                			
                			
                				One blown sail beneath her, hardly making
                				Forth, wild-winged for harbourage yet to be,
                				Strives and leaps and pants beneath the breaking
                				Wind and sea.
