                The wind that brings us from the springtide south
                Strange music as from love's or life's own mouth
                Blew hither, when the blast of battle ceased
                That swept back southward Spanish prince and priest,
                A sound more sweet than April's flower-sweet rain,
                And bade bright England smile on pardoned Spain.
                The land that cast out Philip and his God
                Grew gladly subject where Cervantes trod.
                Even he whose name above all names on earth
                Crowns England queen by grace of Shakespeare's birth
                Might scarce have scorned to smile in God's wise down
                And gild with praise from heaven an earthlier crown.
                And he whose hand bade live down lengthening years
                Quixote, a name lit up with smiles and tears,
                Gave the glad watchword of the gipsies' life,
                Where fear took hope and grief took joy to wife.
                Times change, and fame is fitful as the sea:
                But sunset bids not darkness always be,
                And still some light from Shakespeare and the sun
                Burns back the cloud that masks not Middleton.
                With strong swift strokes of love and wrath he drew
                Shakespearean London's loud and lusty crew:
                No plainer might the likeness rise and stand
                When Hogarth took his living world in hand.
                
                No surer then his fire-fledged shafts could hit,
                Winged with as forceful and as faithful wit:
                No truer a tragic depth and heat of heart
                Glowed through the painter's than the poet's art.
                He lit and hung in heaven the wan fierce moon
                Whose glance kept time with witchcraft's air-struck tune:
                He watched the doors where loveless love let in
                The pageant hailed and crowned by death and sin
                He bared the souls where love, twin-born with hate,
                Made wide the way for passion-fostered fate.
                All English-hearted, all his heart arose
                To scourge with scorn his England's cowering foes:
                And Rome and Spain, who bade their scorner be
                Their prisoner, left his heart as England's free.
                Now give we all we may of all his due
                To one long since thus tried and found thus true.
