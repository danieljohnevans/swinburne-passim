            The Complaint of the Fair Amouress
            
                I
            
                Meseemeth I heard cry and groan
                
                That sweet who was the armourer's maid;
                For her young years she made sore moan,
                And right upon this wise she said;
                Ah fierce old age with foul bald head,
                To spoil fair things thou art over fain;
                Who holdeth me? who? would God I were dead!
                Would God I were well dead and slain!
            
            
            
                II
            
                Lo, thou hast broken the sweet yoke
                That my high beauty held above
                All priests and clerks and merchant-folk;
                There was not one but for my love
                Would give me gold and gold enough,
                Though sorrow his very heart had riven,
                To win from me such wage thereof
                As now no thief would take if given.
            
            
            
            
                III
            
                I was right chary of the same,
                God wot it was my great folly,
                For love of one sly knave of them,
                Good store of that same sweet had he;
                For all my subtle wiles, perdie,
                God wot I loved him well enow;
                Right evilly he handled me,
                But he loved well my gold, I trow.
            
            
            
                IV
            
                Though I gat bruises green and black,
                I loved him never the less a jot;
                Though he bound burdens on my back,
                If he said Kiss me and heed it not
                Right little pain I felt, God wot,
                When that foul thief's mouth, found so sweet,
                Kissed me—Much good thereof I got!
                I keep the sin and the shame of it.
            
            
            
                V
            
                And he died thirty year agone.
                I am old now, no sweet thing to see;
                By God, though, when I think thereon,
                And of that good glad time, woe's me,
                And stare upon my changed body
                Stark naked, that has been so sweet,
                Lean, wizen, like a small dry tree,
                I am nigh mad with the pain of it.
            
            
            
            
                VI
            
                Where is my faultless forehead's white,
                The lifted eyebrows, soft gold hair,
                Eyes wide apart and keen of sight,
                With subtle skill in the amorous air;
                The straight nose, great nor small, but fair,
                The small carved ears of shapeliest growth,
                Chin dimpling, colour good to wear,
                And sweet red splendid kissing mouth?
            
            
            
                VII
            
                The shapely slender shoulders small,
                Long arms, hands wrought in glorious wise,
                Round little breasts, the hips withal
                High, full of flesh, not scant of size,
                Fit for all amorous masteries;
                *** ***** *****, *** *** ****** **** ***
                ******* ***** ** **** ***** ******
                ** * ***** ****** ** **** *****?
            
            
            
                VIII
            
                A writhled forehead, hair gone grey,
                Fallen eyebrows, eyes gone blind and red,
                Their laughs and looks all fled away,
                Yea, all that smote men's hearts are fled;
                The bowed nose, fallen from goodlihead;
                Foul flapping ears like water-flags;
                Peaked chin, and cheeks all waste and dead,
                And lips that are two skinny rags:
            
            
            
            
                IX    
            
                Thus endeth all the beauty of us.
                The arms made short, the hands made lean,
                The shoulders bowed and ruinous,
                The breasts, alack! all fallen in;
                The flanks too, like the breasts, grown thin;
                ** *** *** ***** *****, *** ** **!
                For the lank thighs, no thighs but skin,
                They are specked with spots like sausage-meat.
            
            
            
                X
            
                So we make moan for the old sweet days,
                Poor old light women, two or three
                Squatting above the straw-fire's blaze,
                The bosom crushed against the knee,
                Like faggots on a heap we be,
                Round fires soon lit, soon quenched and done;
                And we were once so sweet, even we!
                Thus fareth many and many an one.
            
            
        
    
            
                
                
        
            
            A Double Ballad of Good Counsel
            
                Now take your fill of love and glee,
                And after balls and banquets hie;
                In the end ye'll get no good for fee,
                But just heads broken by and by;
                Light loves make beasts of men that sigh;
                They changed the faith of Solomon,
                And left not Samson lights to spy;
                Good luck has he that deals with none!
            
            
                Sweet Orpheus, lord of minstrelsy,
                For this with flute and pipe came nigh
                The danger of the dog's heads three
                That ravening at hell's door doth lie;
                Fain was Narcissus, fair and shy,
                For love's love lightly lost and won,
                In a deep well to drown and die;
                Good luck has he that deals with none!
            
            
                Sardana, flower of chivalry,
                Who conquered Crete with horn and cry,
                For this was fain a maid to be
                And learn with girls the thread to ply;
                King David, wise in prophecy,
                Forgot the fear of God for one
                Seen washing either shapely thigh;
                Good luck has he that deals with none!
            
            
            
                For this did Amnon, craftily
                Feigning to eat of cakes of rye,
                Deflower his sister fair to see,
                Which was foul incest; and hereby
                Was Herod moved, it is no lie,
                To lop the head of Baptist John
                For dance and jig and psaltery;
                Good luck has he that deals with none!
            
            
                Next of myself I tell, poor me,
                How thrashed like clothes at wash was I
                Stark naked, I must needs agree;
                Who made me eat so sour a pie
                But Katherine of Vaucelles? thereby,
                Noé took third part of that fun;
                Such wedding-gloves are ill to buy;
                Good luck has he that deals with none!
            
            
                But for that young man fair and free
                To pass those young maids lightly by,
                Nay, would you burn him quick, not he;
                Like broom-horsed witches though he fry,
                They are sweet as civet in his eye;
                But trust them, and you're fooled anon;
                For white or brown, and low or high,
                Good luck has he that deals with none!
            
        

    
            
                
                
        
            
            Fragment on Death
            
                And Paris be it or Helen dying,
                Who dies soever, dies with pain.
                He that lacks breath and wind for sighing,
                His gall bursts on his heart; and then
                He sweats, God knows what sweat!—again,
                No man may ease him of his grief;
                Child, brother, sister, none were fain
                To bail him thence for his relief.
            
            
                Death makes him shudder, swoon, wax pale,
                Nose bend, veins stretch, and breath surrender,
                Neck swell, flesh soften, joints that fail
                Crack their strained nerves and arteries slender.
                O woman's body found so tender,
                Smooth, sweet, so precious in men's eyes,
                Must thou too bear such count to render?
                Yes; or pass quick into the skies.
            
            
                [In the original here follows
                Villon's masterpiece, the matchless Ballad of the Ladies of Old Time, so
                incomparably rendered in the marvellous version of D. G. Rossetti; followed in its turn
                by the succeeding poem, as inferior to its companion as is my attempt at translation of
                it to his triumph in that higher and harder field.—A. C. S.]
            
        
    
            
                
                
        
            
            Ballad of the Lords of Old Time
            (After the Former Argument)
            
                What more? Where is the third Calixt,
                Last of that name now dead and gone,
                Who held four years the Papalist? 
                Alphonso king of Aragon,
                The gracious lord, duke of Bourbon,
                And Arthur, duke of old Britaine?
                And Charles the Seventh, that worthy one?
                Even with the good knight Charlemain.
            
            
                The Scot too, king of mount and mist,
                With half his face vermilion,
                Men tell us, like an amethyst
                From brow to chin that blazed and shone;
                The Cypriote king of old renown,
                Alas! and that good king of Spain,
                Whose name I cannot think upon?
                Even with the good knight Charlemain.
            
            
                No more to say of them I list;
                'Tis all but vain, all dead and done:
                For death may no man born resist,
                Nor make appeal when death comes on.
                I make yet one more question;
                Where's Lancelot, king of far Bohain?
                Where's he whose grandson called him son?
                Even with the good knight Charlemain.
            
            
            
                Where is Guesclin, the good Breton?
                The lord of the eastern mountain-chain,
                And the good late duke of Alençon?
                Even with the good knight Charlemain.
            
        

    
            
                
                
        
            
            Ballad of the Women of Paris
            
                Albeit the Venice girls get praise
                For their sweet speech and tender air,
                And though the old women have wise ways
                Of chaffering for amorous ware,
                Yet at my peril dare I swear,
                Search Rome, where God's grace mainly tarries,
                Florence and Savoy, everywhere,
                There's no good girl's lip out of Paris.
            
            
                The Naples women, as folk prattle,
                Are sweetly spoken and subtle enough:
                German girls are good at tattle,
                And Prussians make their boast thereof;
                Take Egypt for the next remove,
                Or that waste land the Tartar harries,
                Spain or Greece, for the matter of love,
                There's no good girl's lip out of Paris.
            
            
                Breton and Swiss know nought of the matter,
                Gascony girls or girls of Toulouse;
                Two fishwives here with a half-hour's chatter
                Would shut them up by threes and twos;
                Calais, Lorraine, and all their crews,
                (Names enow the mad song marries)
                England and Picardy, search them and choose,
                There's no good girl's lip out of Paris.
            
            
            
                Prince, give praise to our French ladies
                For the sweet sound their speaking carries;
                'Twixt Rome and Cadiz many a maid is,
                But no good girl's lip out of Paris.
            
        

    
            
                
                
        
            
            Ballad Written for a Bridegroom
            which Villon gave to a gentelman newly married tosend to his wife whom he had won with the sword
            
                At daybreak, when the falcon claps his wings,
                No whit for grief, but noble heart and high,
                With loud glad noise he stirs himself and springs,
                And takes his meat and toward his lure draws nigh;
                Such good I wish you! Yea, and heartily
                I am fired with hope of true love's meed to get;
                Know that Love writes it in his book; for why,
                This is the end for which we twain are met.
            
            
                Mine own heart's lady with no gainsayings
                You shall be always wholly till I die;
                And in my right against all bitter things
                Sweet laurel with fresh rose its force shall try;
                Seeing reason wills not that I cast love by
                (Nor here with reason shall I chide or fret)
                Nor cease to serve, but serve more constantly;
                This is the end for which we twain are met.
            
            
                And, which is more, when grief about me clings
                Through Fortune's fit or fume of jealousy,
                Your sweet kind eye beats down her threatenings
                As wind doth smoke; such power sits in your eye.
                
                Thus in your field my seed of harvestry
                Thrives, for the fruit is like me that I set;
                God bids me tend it with good husbandry;
                This is the end for which we twain are met.
            
            
                Princess, give ear to this my summary;
                That heart of mine your heart's love should forget
                Shall never be: like trust in you put I:
                This is the end for which we twain are met.
            
        

    
            
                
                
        
            
            Ballad Against the Enemies of France
            
                May he fall in with beasts that scatter fire,
                Like Jason, when he sought the fleece of gold,
                Or change from man to beast three years entire,
                As King Nebuchadnezzar did of old;
                Or else have times as shameful and as bad
                As Trojan folk for ravished Helen had;
                Or gulfed with Proserpine and Tantalus
                Let hell's deep fen devour him dolorous,
                With worse to bear than Job's worst sufferance,
                Bound in his prison-maze with Dædalus,
                Who could wish evil to the state of France!
            
            
                May he four months, like bitterns in the mire,
                Howl with head downmost in the lake-springs cold,
                Or to bear harness like strong bulls for hire
                To the Great Turk for money down be sold;
                Or thirty years like Magdalen live sad,
                With neither wool nor web of linen clad;
                Drown like Narciss', or swing down pendulous
                Like Absalom with locks luxurious,
                Or liker Judas fallen to reprobance;
                Or find such death as Simon sorcerous,
                Who could wish evil to the state of France!
            
            
                May the old times come of fierce Octavian's ire,
                And in his belly molten coin be told;
                May he like Victor in the mill expire,
                Crushed between moving millstones on him rolled,
                
                Or in deep sea drenched breathless, more adrad
                Than in the whale's bulk Jonas, when God bade:
                From Phœbus' light, from Juno's treasure-house
                Driven, and from joys of Venus amorous,
                And cursed of God most high to the utterance,
                As was the Syrian king Antiochus,
                Who could wish evil to the state of France!
            
            
                Prince, may the bright-winged brood of Æolus
                To sea-king Glaucus' wild wood cavernous
                Bear him bereft of peace and hope's least glance,
                For worthless is he to get good of us,
                Who could wish evil to the state of France.
            
        

    
            
                
                
        
            
            The Dispute of the Heart and Body of François Villon
            
                Who is this I hear? — Lo, this is I, thine heart,
                That holds on merely now by a slender string.
                Strength fails me, shape and sense are rent apart,
                The blood in me is turned to a bitter thing,
                Seeing thee skulk here like a dog shivering. —
                Yea, and for what?—For that thy sense found sweet. — 
                What irks it thee?—I feel the sting of it. —
                Leave me at peace. — Why? — Nay now, leave me at peace;
                I will repent when I grow ripe in wit. —
                I say no more. — I care not though thou cease. —
            
            
                What art thou, trow? — A man worth praise, perfay. —
                This is thy thirtieth year of wayfaring. —
                'Tis a mule's age. — Art thou a boy still? — Nay. —
                Is it hot lust that spurs thee with its sting,
                Grasping thy throat? Know'st thou not anything? —
                Yea, black and white, when milk is specked with flies,
                I can make out. — No more? — Nay, in no wise.
                Shall I begin again the count of these? —
                Thou art undone. — I will make shift to rise. —
                I say no more. — I care not though thou cease. —
            
            
            
                I have the sorrow of it, and thou the smart.
                Wert thou a poor mad fool or weak of wit,
                Then might'st thou plead this pretext with thine heart;
                But if thou know not good from evil a whit,
                Either thy head is hard as stone to hit,
                Or shame, not honour, gives thee most content.
                What canst thou answer to this argument? —
                When I am dead I shall be well at ease. —
                God! what good hope! — Thou art over eloquent. —
                I say no more. — I care not though thou cease. —
            
            
                Whence is this ill? — From sorrow and not from sin.
                When Saturn packed my wallet up for me
                I well believe he put these ills therein. —
                Fool, wilt thou make thy servant lord of thee?
                Hear now the wise king's counsel; thus saith he:
                All power upon the stars a wise man hath;
                There is no planet that shall do him scathe. —
                Nay, as they made me I grow and I decrease. —
                What say'st thou? — Truly this is all my faith. —
                I say no more. — I care not though thou cease. —
            
            
                Wouldst thou live still? — God help me that I may! —
                Then thou must — What? turn penitent and pray? —
                Read always — What? — Grave words and good to say;
                Leave off the ways of fools, lest they displease. —
                Good; I will do it. — Wilt thou remember? — Yea. —
                Abide not till there come an evil day.
                I say no more. — I care not though thou cease.
            
        

    
            
                
                
        
            
            Epistle in Form of a Ballad to his Friends
            
                Have pity, pity, friends, have pity on me,
                Thus much at least, may it please you, of your grace!
                I lie not under hazel or hawthorn-tree
                Down in this dungeon ditch, mine exile's place
                By leave of God and fortune's foul disgrace.
                Girls, lovers, glad young folk and newly wed,
                Jumpers and jugglers, tumbling heel o'er head,
                Swift as a dart, and sharp as needle-ware,
                Throats clear as bells that ring the kine to shed,
                Your poor old friend, what, will you leave him there?
            
            
                Singers that sing at pleasure, lawlessly,
                Light, laughing, gay of word and deed, that race
                And run like folk light-witted as ye be
                And have in hand nor current coin nor base,
                Ye wait too long, for now he's dying apace.
                Rhymers of lays and roundels sung and read,
                Ye'll brew him broth too late when he lies dead.
                Nor wind nor lightning, sunbeam nor fresh air,
                May pierce the thick wall's bound where lies his bed;
                Your poor old friend, what, will you leave him there?
            
            
            
                O noble folk from tithes and taxes free,
                Come and behold him in this piteous case,
                Ye that nor king nor emperor holds in fee,
                But only God in heaven; behold his face
                Who needs must fast, Sundays and holidays,
                Which makes his teeth like rakes; and when he hath fed
                With never a cake for banquet but dry bread,
                Must drench his bowels with much cold watery fare,
                With board nor stool, but low on earth instead;
                Your poor old friend, what, will you leave him there?
            
            
                Princes afore-named, old and young foresaid,
                Get me the king's seal and my pardon sped,
                And hoist me in some basket up with care:
                So swine will help each other ill bested,
                For where one squeaks they run in heaps ahead.
                Your poor old friend, what, will you leave him there?
            
        

    
            
                
                
        
            
            The Epitaph in Form of a Ballad
            which Villon made for himself and his comrades, 
            expecting to be hanged along with them
            
                Men, brother men, that after us yet live,
                Let not your hearts too hard against us be;
                For if some pity of us poor men ye give,
                The sooner God shall take of you pity.
                Here are we five or six strung up, you see,
                And here the flesh that all too well we fed
                Bit by bit eaten and rotten, rent and shred,
                And we the bones grow dust and ash withal;
                Let no man laugh at us discomforted,
                But pray to God that he forgive us all.
            
            
                If we call on you, brothers, to forgive,
                Ye should not hold our prayer in scorn, though we
                Were slain by law; ye know that all alive
                Have not wit alway to walk righteously;
                Make therefore intercession heartily
                With him that of a virgin's womb was bred,
                That his grace be not as a dry well-head
                For us, nor let hell's thunder on us fall;
                We are dead, let no man harry or vex us dead,
                But pray to God that he forgive us all.
            
            
                The rain has washed and laundered us all five,
                And the sun dried and blackened; yea, perdie,
                Ravens and pies with beaks that rend and rive
                Have dug our eyes out, and plucked off for fee
                Our beards and eyebrows; never are we free,
                
                Not once, to rest; but here and there still sped,
                Drive at its wild will by the wind's change led,
                More pecked of birds than fruits on garden-wall;
                Men, for God's love, let no gibe here be said,
                But pray to God that he forgive us all.
            
            
                Prince Jesus, that of all art lord and head,
                Keep us, that hell be not our bitter bed;
                We have nought to do in such a master's hall.
                Be not ye therefore of our fellowhead,
                But pray to God that he forgive us all.
