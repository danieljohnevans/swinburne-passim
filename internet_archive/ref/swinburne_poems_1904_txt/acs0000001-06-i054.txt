                A bell tolls on in my heart
                As though in my ears a knell
                Had ceased for awhile to swell,
                But the sense of it would not part
                From the spirit that bears its part
                In the chime of the soundless bell.
            
            
                Ah dear dead singer of sorrow,
                The burden is now not thine
                That grief bade sound for a sign
                Through the songs of the night whose morrow
                Has risen, and I may not borrow
                A beam from its radiant shrine.
            
            
                The burden has dropped from thee
                That grief on thy life bound fast;
                The winter is over and past
                Whose end thou wast fain to see.
                Shall sorrow not comfort me
                That is thine no longerâ€”at last?
            
            
            
                Good day, good night, and good morrow,
                Men living and mourning say.
                For thee we could only pray
                That night of the day might borrow
                Such comfort as dreams lend sorrow:
                Death gives thee at last good day.
