                Still the sovereign trees
                Make the sundawn's breeze
                More bright, more sweet, more heavenly than it rose,
                As wind and sun fulfil
                Their living rapture: still
                Noon, dawn, and evening thrill
                With radiant change the immeasurable repose
                Wherewith the woodland wilds lie blest
                And feel how storms and centuries rock them still to rest.
            
            
                Still the love-lit place
                Given of God such grace
                That here was born on earth a birth divine
                Gives thanks with all its flowers
                Through all their lustrous hours,
                From all its birds and bowers
                Gives thanks that here they felt her sunset shine
                Where once her sunrise laughed, and bade
                The life of all the living things it lit be glad.
            
            
                Soft as light and strong
                Rises yet their song
                And thrills with pride the cedar-crested lawn
                
                And every brooding dove.
                But she, beloved above
                All utterance known of love,
                Abides no more the change of night and dawn,
                Beholds no more with earth-born eye
                These woods that watched her waking here where all things die.
            
            
                Not the light that shone
                When she looked thereon
                Shines on them or shall shine for ever here.
                We know not, save when sleep
                Slays death, who fain would keep
                His mystery dense and deep,
                Where shines the smile we held and hold so dear.
                Dreams only, thrilled and filled with love,
                Bring back its light ere dawn leave nought alive above.
            
            
                Nought alive awake
                Sees the strong dawn break
                On all the dreams that dying night bade live.
                Yet scarce the intolerant sense
                Of day's harsh evidence
                How came their word and whence
                Strikes dumb the song of thanks it bids them give,
                The joy that answers as it heard
                And lightens as it saw the light that spake the word.
            
            
                Night and sleep and dawn
                Pass with dreams withdrawn:
                But higher above them far than noon may climb
                
                Love lives and turns to light
                The deadly noon of night.
                His fiery spirit of sight
                Endures no curb of change or darkling time.
                Even earth and transient things of earth
                Even here to him bear witness not of death but birth.
