            February 4, 1883
            
                I
                Lord of light, whose shrine no hands destroy,
                God of song, whose hymn no tongue refuses,
                Now, though spring far hence be cold and coy,
                Bid the golden mouths of all the Muses
                Ring forth gold of strains without alloy,
                Till the ninefold rapture that suffuses
                Heaven with song bid earth exult for joy,
                Since the child whose head this dawn bedews is
                Sweet as once thy violet-cradled boy.
            
            
                II
                Even as he lay lapped about with flowers,
                Lies the life now nine years old before us
                Lapped about with love in all its hours;
                Hailed of many loves that chant in chorus
                Loud or low from lush or leafless bowers,
                Some from hearts exultant born sonorous,
                Some scarce louder-voiced than soft-tongued showers
                Two months hence, when spring's light wings poised o'er us
                High shall hover, and her heart be ours.
            
            
            
                III
                Even as he, though man-forsaken, smiled
                On the soft kind snakes divinely bidden
                There to feed him in the green mid wild
                Full with hurtless honey, till the hidden
                Birth should prosper, finding fate more mild,
                So full-fed with pleasures unforbidden,
                So by love's lures blamelessly beguiled,
                Laughs the nursling of our hearts unchidden
                Yet by change that mars not yet the child.
            
            
                IV
                Ah, not yet! Thou, lord of night and day,
                Time, sweet father of such blameless pleasure,
                Time, false friend who tak'st thy gifts away,
                Spare us yet some scantlings of the treasure,
                Leave us yet some rapture of delay,
                Yet some bliss of blind and fearless leisure
                Unprophetic of delight's decay,
                Yet some nights and days wherein to measure
                All the joys that bless us while they may.
            
            
                V
                Not the waste Arcadian woodland, wet
                Still with dawn and vocal with Alpheus,
                Reared a nursling worthier love's regret,
                Lord, than this, whose eyes beholden free us
                Straight from bonds the soul would fain forget,
                Fain cast off, that night and day might see us
                Clear once more of life's vain fume and fret:
                Leave us, then, whate'er thy doom decree us,
                Yet some days wherein to love him yet.
            
            
            
                VI
                Yet some days wherein the child is ours,
                Ours, not thine, O lord whose hand is o'er us
                Always, as the sky with suns and showers
                Dense and radiant, soundless or sonorous;
                Yet some days for love's sake, ere the bowers
                Fade wherein his fair first years kept chorus
                Night and day with Graces robed like hours,
                Ere this worshipped childhood wane before us,
                Change, and bring forth fruit—but no more flowers.
            
            
                VII
                Love we may the thing that is to be,
                Love we must: but how forego this olden
                Joy, this flower of childish love, that we
                Held more dear than aught of Time is holden—
                Time, whose laugh is like as Death's to see—
                Time, who heeds not aught of all beholden,
                Heard, or touched in passing—flower or tree,
                Tares or grain of leaden days or golden—
                More than wind has heed of ships at sea?
            
            
                VIII
                First the babe, a very rose of joy,
                Sweet as hope's first note of jubilation,
                Passes: then must growth and change destroy
                Next the child, and mar the consecration
                Hallowing yet, ere thought or sense annoy,
                Childhood's yet half heavenlike habitation,
                Bright as truth and frailer than a toy;
                Whence its guest with eager gratulation
                Springs, and life grows larger round the boy.
            
            
            
                IX
                Yet, ere sunrise wholly cease to shine,
                Ere change come to chide our hearts, and scatter
                Memories marked for love's sake with a sign,
                Let the light of dawn beholden flatter
                Yet some while our eyes that feed on thine,
                Child, with love that change nor time can shatter,
                Love, whose silent song says more than mine
                Now, though charged with elder loves and latter
                Here it hails a lord whose years are nine.
