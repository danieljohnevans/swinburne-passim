            (B.C. 280)
            Done into English
            
                I
                Thee, the son of God most high,
                Famed for harping song, will I
                Proclaim, and the deathless oracular word
                From the snow-topped rock that we gaze on heard,
                Counsels of thy glorious giving
                Manifest for all men living,
                How thou madest the tripod of prophecy thine
                Which the wrath of the dragon kept guard on, a shrine
                Voiceless till thy shafts could smite
                All his live coiled glittering might.
            
            
                II
                Ye that hold of right alone
                All deep woods on Helicon,
                Fair daughters of thunder-girt God, with your bright
                White arms uplift as to lighten the light,
                Come to chant your brother's praise,
                Gold-haired Ph≈ìbus, loud in lays,
                Even his, who afar up the twin-topped seat
                Of the rock Parnassian whereon we meet
                
                Risen with glorious Delphic maids
                Seeks the soft spring-sweetened shades
                Castalian, fain of the Delphian peak
                Prophetic, sublime as the feet that seek.
                Glorious Athens, highest of state,
                Come, with praise and prayer elate,
                O thou that art queen of the plain unscarred
                That the warrior Tritonid hath alway in guard,
                Where on many a sacred shrine
                Young bulls' thigh-bones burn and shine
                As the god that is fire overtakes them, and fast
                The smoke of Arabia to heavenward is cast,
                Scattering wide its balm: and shrill
                Now with nimble notes that thrill
                The flute strikes up for the song, and the harp of gold
                Strikes up to the song sweet answer: and all behold,
                All, aswarm as bees, give ear,
                Who by birth hold Athens dear.
