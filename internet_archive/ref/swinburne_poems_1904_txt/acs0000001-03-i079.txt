                If we dream that desire of the distance above us
                
                Should be fettered by fear of the shadows that seem,
                If we wake, to be nought, but to hate or to love us
                If we dream,
            
            
                Night sinks on the soul, and the stars as they gleam
                Speak menace or mourning, with tongues to reprove us
                That we deemed of them better than terror may deem.
            
            
                But if hope may not lure us, if fear may not move us,
                Thought lightens the darkness wherein the supreme
                Pure presence of death shall assure us, and prove us
                If we dream.
