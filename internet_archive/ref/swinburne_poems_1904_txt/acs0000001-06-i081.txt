            Barking Hall, July 19th, 1896
            
                Fourscore years and seven
                Light and dew from heaven
                Have fallen with dawn on these glad woods each day
                Since here was born, even here,
                A birth more bright and dear
                Than ever a younger year
                Hath seen or shall till all these pass away,
                Even all the imperious pride of these,
                The woodland ways majestic now with towers of trees.
            
            
                Love itself hath nought
                Touched of tenderest thought
                With holiest hallowing of memorial grace
                For memory, blind with bliss,
                To love, to clasp, to kiss,
                So sweetly strange as this,
                The sense that here the sun first hailed her face,
                A babe at Her glad mother's breast,
                And here again beholds it more beloved and blest.
            
            
            
                Love's own heart, a living
                Spring of strong thanksgiving,
                Can bid no strength of welling song find way
                When all the soul would seek
                One word for joy to speak,
                And even its strength makes weak
                The too strong yearning of the soul to say
                What may not be conceived or said
                While darkness makes division of the quick and dead.
            
            
                Haply, where the sun
                Wanes, and death is none,
                The word known here of silence only, held
                Too dear for speech to wrong,
                May leap in living song
                Forth, and the speech be strong
                As here the silence whence it yearned and welled
                From hearts whose utterance love sealed fast
                Till death perchance might give it grace to live at last.
            
            
                Here we have our earth
                Yet, with all the mirth
                Of all the summers since the world began,
                All strengths of rest and strife
                And love-lit love of life
                Where death has birth to wife,
                And where the sun speaks, and is heard of man:
                Yea, half the sun's bright speech is heard,
                And like the sea the soul of man gives back his word.
            
            
                Earth's enkindled heart
                Bears benignant part
                In the ardent heaven's auroral pride of prime:
                
                If ever home on earth
                Were found of heaven's grace worth
                So God-beloved a birth
                As here makes bright the fostering face of time,
                Here, heaven bears witness, might such grace
                Fall fragrant as the dewfall on that brightening face.
            
            
                Here, for mine and me,
                All that eyes may see
                Hath more than all the wide world else of good,
                All nature else of fair:
                Here as none otherwhere
                Heaven is the circling air,
                Heaven is the homestead, heaven the wold, the wood:
                The fragrance with the shadow spread
                From broadening wings of cedars breathes of dawn's bright bed.
            
            
                Once a dawn rose here
                More divine and dear,
                Rose on a birth-bed brighter far than dawn's,
                Whence all the summer grew
                Sweet as when earth was new
                And pure as Eden's dew:
                And yet its light lives on these lustrous lawns,
                Clings round these wildwood ways, and cleaves
                To the aisles of shadow and sun that wind unweaves and weaves.
            
            
                Thoughts that smile and weep,
                Dreams that hallow sleep,
                Brood in the branching shadows of the trees,
                
                Tall trees at agelong rest
                Wherein the centuries nest,
                Whence, blest as these are blest,
                We part, and part not from delight in these;
                Whose comfort, sleeping as awake,
                We bear about within us as when first it spake.
            
            
                Comfort as of song
                Grown with time more strong,
                Made perfect and prophetic as the sea,
                Whose message, when it lies
                Far off our hungering eyes,
                Within us prophesies
                Of life not ours, yet ours as theirs may be
                Whose souls far off us shine and sing
                As ere they sprang back sunward, swift as fire might spring.
            
            
                All this oldworld pleasance
                Hails a hallowing presence,
                And thrills with sense of more than summer near,
                And lifts toward heaven more high
                The song-surpassing cry
                Of rapture that July
                Lives, for her love who makes it loveliest here;
                For joy that she who here first drew
                The breath of life she gave me breathes it here anew.
            
            
                Never birthday born
                Highest in height of morn
                Whereout the star looks forth that leads the sun
                
                Shone higher in love's account,
                Still seeing the mid noon mount
                From the eager dayspring's fount
                Each year more lustrous, each like all in one;
                Whose light around us and above
                We could not see so lovely save by grace of love.
