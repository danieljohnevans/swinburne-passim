                Return, we dare not as we fain
                Would cry from hearts that yearn:
                Love dares not bid our dead again
                Return.
            
            
                O hearts that strain and burn
                As fires fast fettered burn and strain!
                Bow down, lie still, and learn.
            
            
                The heart that healed all hearts of pain
                No funeral rites inurn:
                Its echoes, while the stars remain,
                Return.
            
            
                May 1885.
