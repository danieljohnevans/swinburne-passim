                Push hard across the sand,
                For the salt wind gathers breath;
                Shoulder and wrist and hand,
                Push hard as the push of death.
            
            
                The wind is as iron that rings,
                The foam-heads loosen and flee;
                It swells and welters and swings,
                The pulse of the tide of the sea.
            
            
                And up on the yellow cliff
                The long corn flickers and shakes;
                Push, for the wind holds stiff,
                And the gunwale dips and rakes.
            
            
                Good hap to the fresh fierce weather,
                The quiver and beat of the sea!
                While three men hold together,
                The kingdoms are less by three.
            
            
                Out to the sea with her there,
                Out with her over the sand;
                Let the kings keep the earth for their share!
                We have done with the sharers of land.
            
            
            
                They have tied the world in a tether,
                They have bought over God with a fee;
                While three men hold together,
                The kingdoms are less by three.
            
            
                We have done with the kisses that sting,
                The thief’s mouth red from the feast,
                The blood on the hands of the king
                And the lie at the lips of the priest.
            
            
                Will they tie the winds in a tether,
                Put a bit in the jaws of the sea?
                While three men hold together,
                The kingdoms are less by three.
            
            
                Let our flag run out straight in the wind!
                The old red shall be floated again
                When the ranks that are thin shall be thinned,
                When the names that were twenty are ten;
            
            
                When the devil’s riddle is mastered
                And the galley-bench creaks with a Pope,
                We shall see Buonaparte the bastard
                Kick heels with his throat in a rope.
            
            
                While the shepherd sets wolves on his sheep
                And the emperor halters his kine,
                While Shame is a watchman asleep
                And Faith is a keeper of swine,
            
            
                Let the wind shake our flag like a feather,
                Like the plumes of the foam of the sea!
                While three men hold together,
                The kingdoms are less by three.
            
            
            
                All the world has its burdens to bear,
                From Cayenne to the Austrian whips;
                Forth, with the rain in our hair
                And the salt sweet foam in our lips;
            
            
                In the teeth of the hard glad weather,
                In the blown wet face of the sea;
                While three men hold together,
                The kingdoms are less by three.
