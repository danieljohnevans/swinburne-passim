                What needs our Cromwell stone or bronze to say
                His was the light that lit on England's way
                The sundawn of her time-compelling power,
                The noontide of her most imperial day?
            
            
                His hand won back the sea for England's dower;
                His footfall bade the Moor change heart and cower;
                His word on Milton's tongue spake law to France
                When Piedmont felt the she-wolf Rome devour.
            
            
                From Cromwell's eyes the light of England's glance
                Flashed, and bowed down the kings by grace of chance,
                The priest-anointed princes; one alone
                By grace of England held their hosts in trance.
            
            
                The enthroned Republic from her kinglier throne
                Spake, and her speech was Cromwell's. Earth has known
                No lordlier presence. How should Cromwell stand
                With kinglets and with queenlings hewn in stone?
            
            1Refused by the party of reaction and disunion in the House of Commons on the 17th of June, 1895.
            
            
                Incarnate England in his warrior hand
                Smote, and as fire devours the blackening brand
                Made ashes of their strengths who wrought her wrong,
                And turned the strongholds of her foes to sand.
            
            
                His praise is in the sea's and Milton's song;
                What praise could reach him from the weakling throng
                That rules by leave of tongues whose praise is shameâ€”
                Him, who made England out of weakness strong?
            
            
                There needs no clarion's blast of broad-blown fame
                To bid the world bear witness whence he came
                Who bade fierce Europe fawn at England's heel
                And purged the plague of lineal rule with flame.
            
            
                There needs no witness graven on stone or steel
                For one whose work bids fame bow down and kneel;
                Our man of men, whose time-commanding name
                Speaks England, and proclaims her Commonweal.
