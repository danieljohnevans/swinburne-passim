                A sea that heaves with horror of the night,
                As maddened by the moon that hangs aghast
                With strain and torment of the ravening blast,
                Haggard as hell, a bleak blind bloody light;
                No shore but one red reef of rock in sight,
                Whereon the waifs of many a wreck were cast
                And shattered in the fierce nights overpast
                Wherein more souls toward hell than heaven took flight;
                And 'twixt the shark-toothed rocks and swallowing shoals
                A cry as out of hell from all these souls
                Sent through the sheer gorge of the slaughtering sea,
                Whose thousand throats, full-fed with life by death,
                Fill the black air with foam and furious breath;
                And over all these one starâ€”Chastity.
