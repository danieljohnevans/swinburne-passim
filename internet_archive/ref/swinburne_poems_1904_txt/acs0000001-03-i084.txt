            (On his Translation of "The Arabian
                Nights")
            
                Westward the sun sinks, grave and glad; but far
                Eastward, with laughter and tempestuous tears,
                Cloud, rain, and splendour as of orient spears,
                Keen as the sea's thrill toward a kindling star,
                The sundawn breaks the barren twilight's bar
                And fires the mist and slays it. Years on years
                Vanish, but he that hearkens eastward hears
                Bright music from the world where shadows are.
            
            
                Where shadows are not shadows. Hand in hand
                A man's word bids them rise and smile and stand
                And triumph. All that glorious orient glows
                Defiant of the dusk. Our twilight land
                Trembles; but all the heaven is all one rose,
                Whence laughing love dissolves her frosts and snows.
