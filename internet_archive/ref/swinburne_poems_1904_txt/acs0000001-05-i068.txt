        		1
            

                Since in Athens God stood plain for adoration,

                Since the sun beheld his likeness reared in stone,
                Since the bronze or gold of human consecration
                Gave to Greece her guardian's form and feature shown,
                Never hand of sculptor, never heart of nation,
                Found so glorious aim in all these ages flown
                As is theirs who rear for all time's acclamation
                Here the likeness of our mightiest and their own.

                Theirs and ours and all men's living who behold him
                Crowned with garlands multiform and manifold;
                Praise and thanksgiving of all mankind enfold him
                Who for all men casts abroad his gifts of gold.
                With the gods of song have all men's tongues enrolled him,
                With the helpful gods have all men's hearts enrolled:
                Ours he is who love him, ours whose hearts' hearts hold him
                Fast as his the trust that hearts like his may hold.

                He, the heart most high, the spirit on earth most blameless,
                Takes in charge all spirits, holds all hearts in trust:
                As the sea-wind's on the sea his ways are tameless,
                As the laws that steer the world his works are just.
                All most noble feel him nobler, all most shameless
                Feel his wrath and scorn make pale their pride and lust:
                All most poor and lowliest, all whose wrongs were nameless,
                Feel his word of comfort raise them from the dust.

                Pride of place and lust of empire bloody-fruited
                Knew the blasting of his breath on leaf and fruit:
                Now the hand that smote the death-tree now disrooted
                Plants the refuge-tree that has man's hope for root.
                Ah, but we by whom his darkness was saluted,
                How shall now all we that see his day salute?
                How should love not seem by love's own speech confuted,
                Song before the sovereign singer not be mute?
            
        	
        	
        		5
            
                With what worship, by what blessing, in what measure,
                May we sing of him, salute him, or adore,
                With what hymn for praise, what thanksgiving for pleasure,
                Who had given us more than heaven, and gives us more?
            	
                Heaven's whole treasury, filled up full with night's whole treasure,
                Holds not so divine or deep a starry store
                As the soul supreme that deals forth worlds at leisure
                Clothed with light and darkness, dense with flower and ore.

                Song had touched the bourn: fresh verses overflow it,
                Loud and radiant, waves on waves on waves that throng;
                Still the tide grows, and the sea-mark still below it
                Sinks and shifts and rises, changed and swept along.
                Rose it like a rock? the waters overthrow it,
                And another stands beyond them sheer and strong:
                Goal by goal pays down its prize, and yields its poet
                Tribute claimed of triumph, palm achieved of song.
            
        	
        	
        		7
            
                Since his hand that holds the keys of fear and wonder
                Opened on the high priest's dreaming eyes a door
                Whence the lights of heaven and hell above and under
                Shone, and smote the face that men bow down before,
                Thrice again one singer's note had cloven in sunder
                Night, who blows again not one blast now but four,
                And the fourfold heaven is kindled with his thunder,
                And the stars about his forehead are fourscore.
            
        		
        	
        	
        		8
            
                From the deep soul's depths where alway love abounded
                First had risen a song with healing on its wings
                Whence the dews of mercy raining balms unbounded
                Shed their last compassion even on sceptred things.1
                Even on heads that like a curse the crown surrounded
                Fell his crowning pity, soft as cleansing springs;
                And the sweet last note his wrath relenting sounded
                Bade men's hearts be melted not for slaves but kings.

                Next, that faith might strengthen fear and love embolden,
                On the creeds of priests a scourge of sunbeams fell:
                And its flash made bare the deeps of heaven, beholden
                Not of men that cry, Lord, Lord, from church or cell.2
                Hope as young as dawn from night obscure and olden
                Rose again, such power abides in truth's one spell:
                Night, if dawn it be that touches her, grows golden;
                Tears, if such as angels weep, extinguish hell.

                Through the blind loud mills of barren blear-eyed learning
                Where in dust and darkness children's foreheads bow,
                While men's labour, vain as wind or water turning
                Wheels and sails of dreams, makes life a leafless bough,

                Fell the light of scorn and pity touched with yearning,
                Next, from words that shone as heaven's own kindling brow.1
                Stars were these as watch-fires on the world's waste burning,
                Stars that fade not in the fourfold sunrise now. 2

                Now the voice that faints not till all wrongs be wroken
                Sounds as might the sun's song from the morning's breast,
                All the seals of silence sealed of night are broken,
                All the winds that bear the fourfold word are blest.
                All the keen fierce east flames forth one fiery token;
                All the north is loud with life that knows not rest,
                All the south with song as though the stars had spoken;
                All the judgment-fire of sunset scathes the west.

                Sound of pæan, roll of chanted panegyric,
                Though by Pindar's mouth song's trumpet spake forth praise,
                March of warrior songs in Pythian mood or Pyrrhic,
                Though the blast were blown by lips of ancient days,

                Ring not clearer than the clarion of satiric
                Song whose breath sweeps bare the plague-infected ways
                Till the world be pure as heaven is for the lyric
                Sun to rise up clothed with radiant sounds as rays.

                Clear across the cloud-rack fluctuant and erratic
                As the strong star smiles that lets no mourner mourn,
                Hymned alike from lips of Lesbian choirs or Attic
                Once at evensong and morning newly born,
                Clear and sure above the changes of dramatic
                Tide and current, soft with love and keen with scorn,
                Smiles the strong sweet soul of maidenhood, ecstatic
                And inviolate as the red glad mouth of morn.

                Pure and passionate as dawn, whose apparition
                Thrills with fire from heaven the wheels of hours that whirl,
                Rose and passed her radiance in serene transition
                From his eyes who sought a grain and found a pearl.
                But the food by cunning hope for vain fruition
                Lightly stolen away from keeping of a churl
                Left the bitterness of death and hope's perdition
                On the lip that scorn was wont for shame to curl.1

                Over waves that darken round the wave-worn rover
                Rang his clarion higher than winds cried round the ship,
                Rose a pageant of set suns and storms blown over,
                Hands that held life's guerdons fast or let them slip.
                But no tongue may tell, no thanksgiving discover,
                Half the heaven of blessing, soft with clouds that drip,
                Keen with beams that kindle, dear as love to lover,
                Opening by the spell's strength on his lyric lip.

                By that spell the soul transfigured and dilated
                Puts forth wings that widen, breathes a brightening air,
                Feeds on light and drinks of music, whence elated
                All her sense grows godlike, seeing all depths made bare,
                All the mists wherein before she sat belated
                Shrink, till now the sunlight knows not if they were;
                All this earth transformed is Eden recreated,
                With the breath of heaven remurmuring in her hair.

                Sweeter far than aught of sweet that April nurses
                Deep in dew-dropt woodland folded fast and furled
                Breathes the fragrant song whose burning dawn disperses
                Darkness, like the surge of armies backward hurled,
            			
            	
                Even as though the touch of spring's own hand, that pierces
                Earth with life's delight, had hidden in the impearled
                Golden bells and buds and petals of his verses
                All the breath of all the flowers in all the world.

                But the soul therein, the light that our souls follow,
                Fires and fills the song with more of prophet's pride,
                More of life than all the gulfs of death may swallow,
                More of flame than all the might of night may hide.
                Though the whole dark age were loud and void and hollow,
                Strength of trust were here, and help for all souls tried,
                And a token from the flight of that strange swallow1
                Whose migration still is toward the wintry side

                Never came such token for divine solution
                From the oraculous live darkness whence of yore
                Ancient faith sought word of help and retribution,
                Truth to lighten doubt, a sign to go before.
                Never so baptismal waters of ablution
                Bathed the brows of exile on so stern a shore,
                Where the lightnings of the sea of revolution
                Flashed across them ere its thunders yet might roar.
