                A fire of fierce and laughing light
                That clove the shuddering heart of night
                Leapt earthward, and the thunder's might
                That pants and yearns
                Made fitful music round its flight:
                And earth saw Burns.
            
            
                The joyous lightning found its voice
                And bade the heart of wrath rejoice
                And scorn uplift a song to voice
                The imperial hate
                That smote the God of base men's choice
                At God's own gate.
            
            
                Before the shrine of dawn, wherethrough
                The lark rang rapture as she flew,
                It flashed and fired the darkling dew:
                And all that heard
                With love or loathing hailed anew
                A new day's word.
            
            
            
                The servants of the lord of hell,
                As though their lord had blessed them, fell
                Foaming at mouth for fear, so well
                They knew the lie
                Wherewith they sought to scan and spell
                The unsounded sky.
            
            
                And Calvin, night's prophetic bird,
                Out of his home in hell was heard
                Shrieking; and all the fens were stirred
                Whence plague is bred;
                Can God endure the scoffer's word?
                But God was dead.
            
            
                The God they made them in despite
                Of man and woman, love and light,
                Strong sundawn and the starry night,
                The lie supreme,
                Shot through with song, stood forth to sight
                A devil's dream.
            
            
                And he that bent the lyric bow
                And laid the lord of darkness low
                And bade the fire of laughter glow
                Across his grave,
                And bade the tides above it flow,
                Wave hurtling wave,
            
            
                Shall he not win from latter days
                More than his own could yield of praise?
                Ay, could the sovereign singer's bays
                Forsake his brow,
                The warrior's, won on stormier ways,
                Still clasp it now.
            
            
            
                He loved, and sang of love: he laughed,
                And bade the cup whereout he quaffed
                Shine as a planet, fore and aft,
                And left and right,
                And keen as shoots the sun's first shaft
                Against the night.
            
            
                But love and wine were moon and sun
                For many a fame long since undone,
                And sorrow and joy have lost and won
                By stormy turns
                As many a singer's soul, if none
                More bright than Burns.
            
            
                And sweeter far in grief or mirth
                Have songs as glad and sad of birth
                Found voice to speak of wealth or dearth
                In joy of life:
                But never song took fire from earth
                More strong for strife.
            
            
                The daisy by his ploughshare cleft,
                The lips of women loved and left,
                The griefs and joys that weave the weft
                Of human time,
                With craftsman's cunning, keen and deft,
                He carved in rhyme.
            
            
                But Chaucer's daisy shines a star
                Above his ploughshare's reach to mar,
                And mightier vision gave Dunbar
                More strenuous wing
                To hear around all sins that are
                Hell dance and sing.
            
            
            
                And when such pride and power of trust
                In song's high gift to arouse from dust
                Death, and transfigure love or lust
                Through smiles or tears
                In golden speech that takes no rust
                From cankering years,
            
            
                As never spake but once in one
                Strong star-crossed child of earth and sun,
                Villon, made music such as none
                May praise or blame,
                A crown of starrier flower was won
                Than Burns may claim.
            
            
                But never, since bright earth was born
                In rapture of the enkindling morn,
                Might godlike wrath and sunlike scorn
                That was and is
                And shall be while false weeds are worn
                Find word like his.
            
            
                Above the rude and radiant earth
                That heaves and glows from firth to firth
                In vale and mountain, bright in dearth
                And warm in wealth,
                Which gave his fiery glory birth
                By chance and stealth,
            
            
                Above the storms of praise and blame
                That blur with mist his lustrous name,
                His thunderous laughter went and came,
                And lives and flies;
                The roar that follows on the flame
                When lightning dies.
            
            
            
                Earth, and the snow-dimmed heights of air,
                And water winding soft and fair
                Through still sweet places, bright and bare,
                By bent and byre,
                Taught him what hearts within them were:
                But his was fire.
