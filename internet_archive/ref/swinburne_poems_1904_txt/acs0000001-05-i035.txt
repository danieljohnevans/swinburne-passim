                				Blest in death and life beyond man's guessing
                				Little children live and die, possest
                				Still of grace that keeps them past expressing
                				Blest.
                			
                			
                				Each least chirp that rings from every nest,
                				Each least touch of flower-soft fingers pressing
                				Aught that yearns and trembles to be prest,
                			
                			
                				Each least glance, gives gift of grace, redressing
                				Grief's worst wrongs: each mother's nurturing breast
                				Feeds a flower of bliss, beyond all blessing
                				Blest.
