    				In memory of Mrs. Thellusson
    				
    					Forth of our ways and woes,
    					Forth of the winds and snows,
    					A white soul soaring goes,
    					Winged like a dove:
    					So sweet, so pure, so clear,
    					So heavenly tempered here,
    					Love need not hope or fear her changed above:
    				
    				
    					Ere dawned her day to die,
    					So heavenly, that on high
    					Change could not glorify
    					Nor death refine her:
    					Pure gold of perfect love,
    					On earth like heaven's own dove,
    					She cannot wear, above, a smile diviner.
    				
    				
    					Her voice in heaven's own quire
    					Can sound no heavenlier lyre
    					Than here: no purer fire
    					Her soul can soar:
    					No sweeter stars her eyes
    					In unimagined skies
    					Beyond our sight can rise than here before.
    				
    				
    				
    					Hardly long years had shed
    					Their shadows on her head:
    					Hardly we think her dead,
    					Who hardly thought her
    					Old: hardly can believe
    					The grief our hearts receive
    					And wonder while they grieve, as wrong were wrought her.
    				
    				
    					But though strong grief be strong
    					No word or thought of wrong
    					May stain the trembling song,
    					Wring the bruised heart,
    					That sounds or sighs its faint
    					Low note of love, nor taint
    					Grief for so sweet a saint, when such depart.
    				
    				
    					A saint whose perfect soul,
    					With perfect love for goal,
    					Faith hardly might control,
    					Creeds might not harden:
    					A flower more splendid far
    					Than the most radiant star
    					Seen here of all that are in God's own garden.
    				
    				
    					Surely the stars we see
    					Rise and relapse as we,
    					And change and set, may be
    					But shadows too:
    					But spirits that man's lot
    					Could neither mar nor spot
    					Like these false lights are not, being heavenly true.
    				
    				
    				
    					Not like these dying lights
    					Of worlds whose glory smites
    					The passage of the nights
    					Through heaven's blind prison:
    					Not like their souls who see,
    					If thought fly far and free,
    					No heavenlier heaven to be for souls rerisen.
    				
    				
    					A soul wherein love shone
    					Even like the sun, alone,
    					With fervour of its own
    					And splendour fed,
    					Made by no creeds less kind
    					Toward souls by none confined,
    					Could Death's self quench or blind, Love's self were dead.
    				
    				February 4, 1881.
