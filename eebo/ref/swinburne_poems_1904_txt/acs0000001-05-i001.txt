				Dedication
			    To Mrs. Lynn Linton
				
					Daughter in spirit elect and consecrate
					By love and reverence of the Olympian sire
					Whom I too loved and worshipped, seeing so great,
					And found so gracious toward my long desire
					To bid that love in song before his gate
					Sound, and my lute be loyal to his lyre,
					To none save one it now may dedicate
					Song's new burnt-offering on a century's pyre.
					And though the gift be light
					As ashes in men's sight,
					Left by the flame of no ethereal fire,
					Yet, for his worthier sake
					Than words are worthless, take
					This wreath of words ere yet their hour expire:
					So, haply, from some heaven above,
					He, seeing, may set next yours my sacrifice of love.

			SONG FOR THE CENTENARY OF  WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR
			
			
				1
				Five years beyond an hundred years have seen
				Their winters, white as faith's and age's hue,
				Melt, smiling through brief tears that broke between,
				And hope's young conquering colours reared anew,
				Since, on the day whose edge for kings made keen
				Smote sharper once than ever storm-wind blew,
				A head predestined for the girdling green
				That laughs at lightning all the seasons through,
				Nor frost or change can sunder
				Its crown untouched of thunder,
				Leaf from least leaf of all its leaves that grew
				Alone for brows too bold
				For storm to sear of old,
				Elect to shine in time's eternal view,
				Rose on the verge of radiant life
				Between the winds and sunbeams mingling love with strife.
			
			
				2
				The darkling day that gave its bloodred birth
				To Milton's white republic undefiled
				That might endure so few fleet years on earth
				Bore in him likewise as divine a child;
				
				But born not less for crowns of love and mirth,
				Of palm and myrtle passionate and mild,
				The leaf that girds about with gentler girth
				The brow steel-bound in battle, and the wild
				Soft spray that flowers above
				The flower-soft hair of love;
				And the white lips of wayworn winter smiled
				And grew serene as spring's
				When with stretched clouds like wings
				Or wings like drift of snow-clouds massed and piled
				The godlike giant, softening, spread
				A shadow of stormy shelter round the new-born head.
			
			
				3
				And o'er it brightening bowed the wild-haired hour,
				And touched his tongue with honey and with fire,
				And breathed between his lips the note of power
				That makes of all the winds of heaven a lyre
				Whose strings are stretched from topmost peaks that tower
				To softest springs of waters that suspire,
				With sounds too dim to shake the lowliest flower
				Breathless with hope and dauntless with desire:
				And bright before his face
				That Hour became a Grace,
				As in the light of their Athenian quire
				When the Hours before the sun
				And Graces were made one,
				Called by sweet Love down from the aerial gyre
				By one dear name of natural joy,
				To bear on her bright breast from heaven a heaven-born boy.
			
			
			
				4
				Ere light could kiss the little lids in sunder
				Or love could lift them for the sun to smite,
				His fiery birth-star as a sign of wonder
				Had risen, perplexing the presageful night
				With shadow and glory around her sphere and under
				And portents prophesying by sound and sight;
				And half the sound was song and half was thunder,
				And half his life of lightning, half of light:
				And in the soft clenched hand
				Shone like a burning brand
				A shadowy sword for swordless fields of fight,
				Wrought only for such lord
				As so may wield the sword
				That all things ill be put to fear and flight
				Even at the flash and sweep and gleam
				Of one swift stroke beheld but in a shuddering dream.
			
			
				5
				Like the sun's rays that blind the night's wild beasts
				The sword of song shines as the swordsman sings;
				From the west wind's verge even to the arduous east's
				The splendour of the shadow that it flings
				Makes fire and storm in heaven above the feasts
				Of men fulfilled with food of evil things;
				Strikes dumb the lying and hungering lips of priests,
				Smites dead the slaying and ravening hands of kings;
				
				Turns dark the lamp's hot light,
				And turns the darkness bright
				As with the shadow of dawn's reverberate wings;
				And far before its way
				Heaven, yearning toward the day,
				Shines with its thunder and round its lightning rings;
				And never hand yet earlier played
				With that keen sword whose hilt is cloud, and fire its blade.
			
			
				6
				
				As dropping flakes of honey-heavy dew
				More soft than slumber's, fell the first note's sound
				From strings the swift young hand strayed lightlier through
				Than leaves through calm air wheeling toward the ground
				Stray down the drifting wind when skies are blue
				Nor yet the wings of latter winds unbound,
				Ere winter loosen all the Æolian crew
				With storm unleashed behind them like a hound.
				As lightly rose and sank
				Beside a green-flowered bank
				The clear first notes his burning boyhood found
				To sing her sacred praise
				Who rode her city's ways
				Clothed with bright hair and with high purpose crowned;
				A song of soft presageful breath,
				Prefiguring all his love and faith in life and death.
			
			
			
				7
				Who should love two things only and only praise
				More than all else for ever: even the glory
				Of goodly beauty in women, whence all days
				Take light whereby death's self seems transitory;
				And loftier love than loveliest eyes can raise,
				Love that wipes off the miry stains and gory
				From Time's worn feet, besmirched on bloodred ways,
				And lightens with his light the night of story;
				Love that lifts up from dust
				Life, and makes darkness just,
				And purges as with fire of purgatory
				The dense disastrous air,
				To burn old falsehood bare
				And give the wind its ashes heaped and hoary;
				Love, that with eyes of ageless youth
				Sees on the breast of Freedom borne her nursling Truth.
			
			
				8
				For at his birth the sistering stars were one
				That flamed upon it as one fiery star;
				Freedom, whose light makes pale the mounting sun,
				And Song, whose fires are quenched when Freedom's are.
				Of all that love not liberty let none
				Love her that fills our lips with fire from far
				To mix with winds and seas in unison
				And sound athwart life's tideless harbour-bar
				Out where our songs fly free
				Across time's bounded sea,
				
				A boundless flight beyond the dim sun's car,
				Till all the spheres of night
				Chime concord round their flight
				Too loud for blasts of warring change to mar,
				From stars that sang for Homer's birth
				To these that gave our Landor welcome back from earth.
			
			
				9
				Shine, as above his cradle, on his grave,
				Stars of our worship, lights of our desire!
				For never man that heard the world's wind rave
				To you was truer in trust of heart and lyre:
				Nor Greece nor England on a brow more brave
				Beheld your flame against the wind burn higher:
				Nor all the gusts that blanch life's worldly wave
				With surf and surge could quench its flawless fire:
				No blast of all that blow
				Might bid the torch burn low
				That lightens on us yet as o'er his pyre,
				Indomitable of storm,
				That now no flaws deform
				Nor thwart winds baffle ere it all aspire,
				One light of godlike breath and flame,
				To write on heaven with man's most glorious names his name.
			
			
				10
				
				The very dawn was dashed with stormy dew
				freaked with fire as when God's hand would mar
				Palaces reared of tyrants, and the blue
				Deep heaven was kindled round her thunderous car,
				
				That saw how swift a gathering glory grew
				About him risen, ere clouds could blind or bar
				A splendour strong to burn and burst them through
				And mix in one sheer light things near and far.
				First flew before his path
				Light shafts of love and wrath,
				But winged and edged as elder warriors' are;
				Then rose a light that showed
				Across the midsea road
				From radiant Calpe to revealed Masar
				The way of war and love and fate
				Between the goals of fear and fortune, hope and hate.
			
			
				11
				Mine own twice banished fathers' harbour-land,
				Their nursing-mother France, the well-beloved,
				By the arduous blast of sanguine sunrise fanned,
				Flamed on him, and his burning lips were moved
				As that live statue's throned on Lybian sand
				When morning moves it, ere her light faith roved
				From promise, and her tyrant's poisonous hand
				Fed hope with Corsic honey till she proved
				More deadly than despair
				And falser even than fair,
				Though fairer than all elder hopes removed
				As landmarks by the crime
				Of inundating time;
				Light faith by grief too loud too long reproved:
				For even as in some darkling dance
				Wronged love changed hands with hate, and turned his heart from France.
			
			
			
				12
				But past the snows and summits Pyrenean
				Love stronger-winged held more prevailing flight
				That o'er Tyrrhene, Iberian, and Ægean
				Shores lightened with one storm of sound and light.
				From earliest even to hoariest years one pæan
				Rang rapture through the fluctuant roar of fight,
				From Nestor's tongue in accents Achillean
				On death's blind verge dominant over night.
				For voice as hand and hand
				As voice for one fair land
				Rose radiant, smote sonorous, past the height
				Where darkling pines enrobe
				The steel-cold Lake of Gaube,
				Deep as dark death and keen as death to smite,
				To where on peak or moor or plain
				His heart and song and sword were one to strike for Spain.
			
			
				13
				
				Resurgent at his lifted voice and hand
				Pale in the light of war or treacherous fate
				Song bade before him all their shadows stand
				For whom his will unbarred their funeral grate.
				The father by whose wrong revenged his land
				Was given for sword and fire to desolate
				Rose fire-encircled as a burning brand,
				Great as the woes he wrought and bore were great.
				Fair as she smiled and died,
				Death's crowned and breathless bride
				Smiled as one living even on craft and hate:
				
				And pity, a star unrisen,
				Scarce lit Ferrante's prison
				Ere night unnatural closed the natural gate
				That gave their life and love and light
				To those fair eyes despoiled by fratricide of sight.
			
			
				14
				
				Tears bright and sweet as fire and incense fell
				In perfect notes of music-measured pain
				On veiled sweet heads that heard not love's farewell
				Sob through the song that bade them rise again;
				Rise in the light of living song, to dwell
				With memories crowned of memory: so the strain
				Made soft as heaven the stream that girdles hell
				And sweet the darkness of the breathless plain,
				And with Elysian flowers
				Recrowned the wreathless hours
				That mused and mourned upon their works in vain;
				For all their works of death
				Song filled with light and breath,
				And listening grief relaxed her lightening chain;
				For sweet as all the wide sweet south
				She found the song like honey from the lion's mouth.
			
			
				15
				
				High from his throne in heaven Simonides,
				Crowned with mild aureole of memorial tears
				That the everlasting sun of all time sees
				All golden, molten from the forge of years,
				Smiled, as the gift was laid upon his knees
				Of songs that hang like pearls in mourners' ears
				Mild as the murmuring of Hymettian bees
				And honied as their harvest, that endears
				
				The toil of flowery days;
				And smiling perfect praise
				Hailed his one brother mateless else of peers:
				Whom we that hear not him
				For length of date grown dim
				Hear, and the heart grows glad of grief that hears;
				And harshest heights of sorrowing hours,
				Like snows of Alpine April, melt from tears to flowers.
			
			
				16
				
				Therefore to him the shadow of death was none,
				The darkness was not, nor the temporal tomb:
				And multitudinous time for him was one,
				Who bade before his equal seat of doom
				Rise and stand up for judgment in the sun
				The weavers of the world's large-historied loom,
				By their own works of light or darkness done
				Clothed round with light or girt about with gloom.
				In speech of purer gold
				Than even they spake of old
				He bade the breath of Sidney's lips relume
				The fire of thought and love
				That made his bright life move
				Through fair brief seasons of benignant bloom
				To blameless music ever, strong
				As death and sweet as death-annihilating song.
			
			
				17
				
				Thought gave his wings the width of time to roam,
				Love gave his thought strength equal to release
				From bonds of old forgetful years, like foam
				Vanished, the fame of memories that decrease;
				
				So strongly faith had fledged for flight from home
				The soul's large pinions till her strife should cease:
				And through the trumpet of a child of Rome
				Rang the pure music of the flutes of Greece.
				As though some northern hand
				Reft from the Latin land
				A spoil more costly than the Colchian fleece
				To clothe with golden sound
				Of old joy newly found
				And rapture as of penetrating peace
				The naked north-wind's cloudiest clime,
				And give its darkness light of the old Sicilian time.
			
			
				18
				
				He saw the brand that fired the towers of Troy
				Fade, and the darkness at Œnone's prayer
				Close upon her that closed upon her boy,
				For all the curse of godhead that she bare;
				And the Apollonian serpent gleam and toy
				With scathless maiden limbs and shuddering hair;
				And his love smitten in their dawn of joy
				Leave Pan the pine-leaf of her change to wear;
				And one in flowery coils
				Caught as in fiery toils
				Smite Calydon with mourning unaware;
				And where her low turf shrine
				Showed Modesty divine
				The fairest mother's daughter far more fair
				Hide on her breast the heavenly shame
				That kindled once with love should kindle Troy with flame.
			
			
			
				19
				
				Nor less the light of story than of song
				With graver glories girt his godlike head,
				Reverted alway from the temporal throng
				Of lives that live not toward the living dead.
				The shadows and the splendours of their throng
				Made bright and dark about his board and bed
				The lines of life and vision, sweet or strong
				With sound of lutes or trumpets blown, that led
				Forth of the ghostly gate
				Opening in spite of fate
				Shapes of majestic or tumultuous tread,
				Divine and direful things,
				These foul as priests or kings,
				Those fair as heaven or love or freedom, red
				With blood and green with palms and white
				With raiment woven of deeds divine and words of light.
			
			
				20
				
				The thunder-fire of Cromwell, and the ray
				That keeps the place of Phocion's name serene
				And clears the cloud from Kosciusko's day,
				Alternate as dark hours with bright between,
				Met in the heaven of his high thought, which lay
				For all stars open that all eyes had seen
				Rise on the night or twilight of the way
				Where feet of human hopes and fears had been.
				Again the sovereign word
				On Milton's lips was heard
				Living: again the tender three days' queen
				
				Drew bright and gentle breath
				On the sharp edge of death:
				And, staged again to show of mortal scene,
				Tiberius, ere his name grew dire,
				Wept, stainless yet of empire, tears of blood and fire.
			
			
				21
				
				Most ardent and most awful and most fond,
				The fervour of his Apollonian eye
				Yearned upon Hellas, yet enthralled in bond
				Of time whose years beheld her and past by
				Silent and shameful, till she rose and donned
				The casque again of Pallas; for her cry
				Forth of the past and future, depths beyond
				This where the present and its tyrants lie,
				As one great voice of twain
				For him had pealed again,
				Heard but of hearts high as her own was high,
				High as her own and his
				And pure as love's heart is,
				That lives though hope at once and memory die:
				And with her breath his clarion's blast
				Was filled as cloud with fire or future souls with past.
			
			
				22
				
				As a wave only obsequious to the wind
				Leaps to the lifting breeze that bids it leap,
				Large-hearted, and its thickening mane be thinned
				By the strong god's breath moving on the deep
				From utmost Atlas even to extremest Ind
				That shakes the plain where no men sow nor reap,
				
				So, moved with wrath toward men that ruled and sinned
				And pity toward all tears he saw men weep,
				Arose to take man's part
				His loving lion heart,
				Kind as the sun's that has in charge to keep
				Earth and the seed thereof
				Safe in his lordly love,
				Strong as sheer truth and soft as very sleep;
				The mightiest heart since Milton's leapt,
				The gentlest since the gentlest heart of Shakespeare slept.
			
			
				23
				
				Like the wind's own on her divided sea
				His song arose on Corinth, and aloud
				Recalled her Isthmian song and strife when she
				Was thronged with glories as with gods in crowd
				And as the wind's own spirit her breath was free
				And as the heaven's own heart her soul was proud,
				But freer and prouder stood no son than he
				Of all she bare before her heart was bowed;
				None higher than he who heard
				Medea's keen last word
				Transpierce her traitor, and like a rushing cloud
				That sundering shows a star
				Saw pass her thunderous car
				And a face whiter and deadlier than a shroud
				That lightened from it, and the brand
				Of tender blood that falling seared his suppliant hand.
			
			
			
				24
				
				More fair than all things born and slain of fate
				More glorious than all births of days and nights,
				He bade the spirit of man regenerate,
				Rekindling, rise and reassume the rights
				That in high seasons of his old estate
				Clothed him and armed with majesties and mights
				Heroic, when the times and hearts were great
				And in the depths of ages rose the heights
				Radiant of high deeds done
				And souls that matched the sun
				For splendour with the lightnings of their lights
				Whence even their uttered names
				Burn like the strong twin flames
				Of song that shakes a throne and steel that smites;
				As on Thermopylæ when shone
				Leonidas, on Syracuse Timoleon.
			
			
				25
				
				Or, sweeter than the breathless buds when spring
				With smiles and tears and kisses bids them breathe,
				Fell with its music from his quiring string
				Fragrance of pine-leaves and odorous heath
				Twined round the lute whereto he sighed to sing
				Of the oak that screened and showed its maid beneath,
				Who seeing her bee crawl back with broken wing
				Faded, a fairer flower than all her wreath,
				And paler, though her oak
				Stood scathless of the stroke
				More sharp than edge of axe or wolfish teeth,
				
				That mixed with mortals dead
				Her own half heavenly head
				And life incorporate with a sylvan sheath,
				And left the wild rose and the dove
				A secret place and sacred from all guests but Love.
			
			
				26
				
				But in the sweet clear fields beyond the river
				Dividing pain from peace and man from shade
				He saw the wings that there no longer quiver
				Sink of the hours whose parting footfalls fade
				On ears which hear the rustling amaranth shiver
				With sweeter sound of wind than ever made
				Music on earth: departing, they deliver
				The soul that shame or wrath or sorrow swayed;
				And round the king of men
				Clash the clear arms again,
				Clear of all soil and bright as laurel braid,
				That rang less high for joy
				Through the gates fallen of Troy
				Than here to hail the sacrificial maid,
				Iphigeneia, when the ford
				Fast-flowing of sorrows brought her father and their lord.
			
			
				27
				
				And in the clear gulf of the hollow sea
				He saw light glimmering through the grave green gloom
				That hardly gave the sun's eye leave to see
				Cymodameia; but nor tower nor tomb,
				No tower on earth, no tomb of waves may be,
				That may not sometime by diviner doom.
				
				Be plain and pervious to the poet; he
				Bids time stand back from him and fate make room
				For passage of his feet,
				Strong as their own are fleet,
				And yield the prey no years may reassume
				Through all their clamorous track,
				Nor night nor day win back
				Nor give to darkness what his eyes illume
				And his lips bless for ever: he
				Knows what earth knows not, sings truth sung not of the sea.
			
			
				28
				
				Before the sentence of a curule chair
				More sacred than the Roman, rose and stood
				To take their several doom the imperial pair
				Diversely born of Venus, and in mood
				Diverse as their one mother, and as fair,
				Though like two stars contrasted, and as good,
				Though different as dark eyes from golden hair;
				One as that iron planet red like blood
				That bears among the stars
				Fierce witness of her Mars
				In bitter fire by her sweet light subdued;
				One in the gentler skies
				Sweet as her amorous eyes:
				One proud of worlds and seas and darkness rude
				Composed and conquered; one content
				With lightnings from loved eyes of lovers lightly sent.
			
			
			
				29
				
				And where Alpheus and where Ladon ran
				Radiant, by many a rushy and rippling cove
				More known to glance of god than wandering man,
				He sang the strife of strengths divine that strove,
				Unequal, one with other, for a span,
				Who should be friends for ever in heaven above
				And here on pastoral earth: Arcadian Pan,
				And the awless lord of kings and shepherds, Love:
				All the sweet strife and strange
				With fervid counterchange
				Till one fierce wail through many a glade and grove
				Rang, and its breath made shiver
				The reeds of many a river,
				And the warm airs waxed wintry that it clove,
				Keen-edged as ice-retempered brand;
				Nor might god's hurt find healing save of godlike hand.
			
			
				30
				
				As when the jarring gates of thunder ope
				Like earthquake felt in heaven, so dire a cry,
				So fearful and so fierce — "Give the sword scope!" —
				Rang from a daughter's lips, darkening the sky
				To the extreme azure of all its cloudless cope
				With starless horror: nor the God's own eye
				Whose doom bade smite, whose ordinance bade hope,
				Might well endure to see the adulteress die,
				The husband-slayer fordone
				By swordstroke of her son,
				Unutterable, unimaginable on high,
				
				On earth abhorrent, fell
				Beyond all scourge of hell,
				Yet righteous as redemption: Love stood nigh,
				Mute, sister-like, and closer clung
				Than all fierce forms of threatening coil and maddening tongue.
			
			
				31
				All these things heard and seen and sung of old,
				He heard and saw and sang them. Once again
				Might foot of man tread, eye of man behold
				Things unbeholden save of ancient men,
				Ways save by gods untrodden. In his hold
				The staff that stayed through some Ætnean glen
				The steps of the most highest, most awful-souled
				And mightiest-mouthed of singers, even as then
				Became a prophet's rod,
				A lyre on fire of God,
				Being still the staff of exile: yea, as when
				The voice poured forth on us
				Was even of Æschylus,
				And his one word great as the crying of ten,
				Crying in men's ears of wrath toward wrong,
				Of love toward right immortal, sanctified with song.
			
			
				32
				
				Him too whom none save one before him ever
				Beheld, nor since hath man again beholden,
				Whom Dante seeing him saw not, nor the giver
				Of all gifts back to man by time withholden,
				Shakespeare — him too, whom sea-like ages sever,
				As waves divide men's eyes from lights upholden
				
				To landward, from our songs that find him never,
				Seeking, though memory fire and hope embolden —
				Him too this one song found,
				And raised at its sole sound
				Up from the dust of darkling dreams and olden
				Legends forlorn of breath,
				Up from the deeps of death,
				Ulysses: him whose name turns all songs golden,
				The wise divine strong soul, whom fate
				Could make no less than change and chance beheld him great.
			
			
				33
				
				Nor stands the seer who raised him less august
				Before us, nor in judgment frail and rathe,
				Less constant or less loving or less just,
				But fruitful-ripe and full of tender faith,
				Holding all high and gentle names in trust
				Of time for honour; so his quickening breath
				Called from the darkness of their martyred dust
				Our sweet Saints Alice and Elizabeth,
				Revived and reinspired
				With speech from heavenward fired
				By love to say what Love the Archangel saith
				Only, nor may such word
				Save by such ears be heard
				As hear the tongues of angels after death
				Descending on them like a dove
				Has taken all earthly sense of thought away but love.
			
			
			
				34
				All sweet, all sacred, all heroic things,
				All generous names and loyal, and all wise,
				With all his heart in all its wayfarings
				He sought, and worshipped, seeing them with his eyes
				In very present glory, clothed with wings
				Of words and deeds and dreams immortal, rise
				Visible more than living slaves and kings,
				Audible more than actual vows and lies:
				These, with scorn's fieriest rod,
				These and the Lord their God,
				The Lord their likeness, tyrant of the skies
				As they Lord Gods of earth,
				These with a rage of mirth
				He mocked and scourged and spat on, in such wise
				That none might stand before his rod,
				And these being slain the Spirit alone be lord or God.
			
			
				35
				
				For of all souls for all time glorious none
				Loved Freedom better, of all who have loved her best,
				Than he who wrote that scripture of the sun
				Writ as with fire and light on heaven's own crest,
				Of all words heard on earth the noblest one
				That ever spake for souls and left them blest:
				Gladly we should rest ever, had we won
				Freedom: we have lost, and very gladly rest.
				O poet hero, lord
				And father, we record
				Deep in the burning tablets of the breast
				
				Thankfully those divine
				And living words of thine
				For faith and comfort in our hearts imprest
				With strokes engraven past hurt of years
				And lines inured with fire of immemorial tears.
			
			
				36
				
				But who being less than thou shall sing of thee
				Words worthy of more than pity or less than scorn?
				Who sing the golden garland woven of three,
				Thy daughters, Graces mightier than the morn,
				More godlike than the graven gods men see
				Made all but all immortal, human born
				And heavenly natured? With the first came He,
				Led by the living hand, who left forlorn
				Life by his death, and time
				More by his life sublime
				Than by the lives of all whom all men mourn,
				And even for mourning praise
				Heaven, as for all those days
				These dead men's lives clothed round with glories worn
				By memory till all time lie dead,
				And higher than all behold the bay round Shakespeare's head.
			
			
				37
				
				Then, fairer than the fairest Grace of ours,
				Came girt with Grecian gold the second Grace,
				And verier daughter of his most perfect hours
				Than any of latter time or alien place
				Named, or with hair inwoven of English flowers
				Only, nor wearing on her statelier face
				
				The lordlier light of Athens. All the Powers
				That graced and guarded round that holiest race,
				That heavenliest and most high
				Time hath seen live and die,
				Poured all their power upon him to retrace
				The erased immortal roll
				Of Love's most sovereign scroll
				And Wisdom's warm from Freedom's wide embrace,
				The scroll that on Aspasia's knees
				Laid once made manifest the Olympian Pericles.
			
			
				38
				
				Clothed on with tenderest weft of Tuscan air,
				Came laughing like Etrurian spring the third,
				With green Valdelsa's hill-flowers in her hair
				Deep-drenched with May-dews, in her voice the bird
				Whose voice hath night and morning in it; fair
				As the ambient gold of wall-flowers that engird
				The walls engirdling with a circling stair
				My sweet San Gimignano: nor a word
				Fell from her flowerlike mouth
				Not sweet with all the south;
				As though the dust shrined in Certaldo stirred
				And spake, as o'er it shone
				That bright Pentameron,
				And his own vines again and chestnuts heard
				Boccaccio: nor swift Elsa's chime
				Mixed not her golden babble with Petrarca's rhyme.
			
			
			
				39
				
				No lovelier laughed the garden which receives
				Yet, and yet hides not from our following eyes
				With soft rose-laurels and low strawberry-leaves,
				Ternissa, sweet as April-coloured skies,
				Bowed like a flowering reed when May's wind heaves
				The reed-bed that the stream kisses and sighs,
				In love that shrinks and murmurs and believes
				What yet the wisest of the starriest wise
				Whom Greece might ever hear
				Speaks in the gentlest ear
				That ever heard love's lips philosophize
				With such deep-reasoning words
				As blossoms use and birds,
				Nor heeds Leontion lingering till they rise
				Far off, in no wise over far,
				Beneath a heaven all amorous of its first-born star.
			
			
				40
				
				What sound, what storm and splendour of what fire,
				Darkening the light of heaven, lightening the night,
				Rings, rages, flashes round what ravening pyre
				That makes time's face pale with its reflex light
				And leaves on earth, who seeing might scarce respire,
				A shadow of red remembrance? Right nor might
				Alternating wore ever shapes more dire
				Nor manifest in all men's awful sight
				In form and face that wore
				Heaven's light and likeness more
				Than these, or held suspense mens hearts at height
				
				More fearful, since man first
				Slaked with man's blood his thirst,
				Than when Rome clashed with Hannibal in fight,
				Till tower on ruining tower was hurled
				Where Scipio stood, and Carthage was not in the world.
			
			
				41
				
				Nor lacked there power of purpose in his hand
				Who carved their several praise in words of gold
				To bare the brows of conquerors and to brand,
				Made shelterless of laurels bought and sold
				For price of blood or incense, dust or sand,
				Triumph or terror. He that sought of old
				His father Ammon in a stranger's land,
				And shrank before the serpentining fold,
				Stood in our seer's wide eye
				No higher than man most high,
				And lowest in heart when highest in hope to hold
				Fast as a scripture furled
				The scroll of all the world
				Sealed with his signet: nor the blind and bold
				First thief of empire, round whose head
				Swarmed carrion flies for bees, on flesh for violets fed.
			
			
				42
				
				As fire that kisses, killing with a kiss,
				He saw the light of death, riotous and red,
				Flame round the bent brows of Semiramis
				Re-risen, and mightier, from the Assyrian dead,
				
					
						
							
								1Thy lifelong works, Napoleon, who shall write?
								Time, in his children's blood who takes delight.
							
						
						
							From the Greek of Landor.
						
					
				
				
				Kindling, as dawn a frost-bound precipice,
				The steely snows of Russia, for the tread
				Of feet that felt before them crawl and hiss
				The snaky lines of blood violently shed
				Like living creeping things
				That writhe but have no stings
				To scare adulterers from the imperial bed
				Bowed with its load of lust,
				Or chill the ravenous gust
				That made her body a fire from heel to head;
				Or change her high bright spirit and clear,
				For all its mortal stains, from taint of fraud or fear.
			
			
				43
				
				As light that blesses, hallowing with a look,
				He saw the godhead in Vittoria's face
				Shine soft on Buonarroti's, till he took,
				Albeit himself God, a more godlike grace,
				A strength more heavenly to confront and brook
				All ill things coiled about his worldly race,
				From the bright scripture of that present book
				Wherein his tired grand eyes got power to trace
				Comfort more sweet than youth,
				And hope whose child was truth,
				And love that brought forth sorrow for a space,
				Only that she might bear
				Joy: these things, written there,
				Made even his soul's high heaven a heavenlier place,
				Perused with eyes whose glory and glow
				Had in their fires the spirit of Michael Angelo.
			
			
			
				44
				
				With balms and dews of blessing he consoled
				The fair fame wounded by the black priest's fang,
				Giovanna's, and washed off her blithe and bold
				Boy-bridegroom's blood, that seemed so long to hang
				On her fair hand, even till the stain of old
				Was cleansed with healing song, that after sang
				Sharp truth by sweetest singers' lips untold
				Of pale Beatrice, though her death-note rang
				From other strings divine
				Ere his rekindling line
				With yet more piteous and intolerant pang
				Pierced all men's hearts anew
				That heard her passion through
				Till fierce from throes of fiery pity sprang
				Wrath, armed for chase of monstrous beasts,
				Strong to lay waste the kingdom of the seed of priests.
			
			
				45
				
				He knew the high-souled humbleness, the mirth
				And majesty of meanest men born free,
				That made with Luther's or with Hofer's birth
				The whole world worthier of the sun to see:
				The wealth of spirit among the snows, the dearth
				Wherein souls festered by the servile sea
				That saw the lowest of even crowned heads on earth
				Thronged round with worship in Parthenope.
				His hand bade Justice guide
				Her child Tyrannicide,
				Light winged by fire that brings the dawn to be;
				
				And pierced with Tyrrel's dart
				Again the riotous heart
				That mocked at mercy's tongue and manhood's knee:
				And oped the cell where kinglike death
				Hung o'er her brows discrowned who bare Elizabeth.
			
			
				46
				
				Toward Spenser or toward Bacon proud or kind
				He bared the heart of Essex, twain and one,
				For the base heart that soiled the starry mind
				Stern, for the father in his child undone
				Soft as his own toward children, stamped and signed
				With their sweet image visibly set on
				As by God's hand, clear as his own designed
				The likeness radiant out of ages gone
				That none may now destroy
				Of that high Roman boy
				Whom Julius and Cleopatra saw their son
				True-born of sovereign seed,
				Foredoomed even thence to bleed,
				The stately grace of bright Cæsarion,
				The head unbent, the heart unbowed,
				That not the shadow of death could make less clear and proud.
			
			
				47
				
				With gracious gods he communed, honouring thus
				At once by service and similitude,
				Service devout and worship emulous
				Of the same golden Muses once they wooed,
				The names and shades adored of all of us,
				The nurslings of the brave world's earlier brood
				
				Grown gods for us themselves: Theocritus
				First, and more dear Catullus, names bedewed
				With blessings bright like tears
				From the old memorial years,
				And loves and lovely laughters, every mood
				Sweet as the drops that fell
				Of their own œnomel
				From living lips to cheer the multitude
				That feeds on words divine, and grows
				More worthy, seeing their world reblossom like a rose.
			
			
				48
				
				Peace, the soft seal of long life's closing story,
				The silent music that no strange note jars,
				Crowned not with gentler hand the years that glory
				Crowned, but could hide not all the spiritual scars
				Time writes on the inward strengths of warriors hoary
				With much long warfare, and with gradual bars
				Blindly pent in: but these, being transitory,
				Broke, and the power came back that passion mars:
				And at the lovely last
				Above all anguish past
				Before his own the sightless eyes like stars
				Arose that watched arise
				Like stars in other skies
				Above the strife of ships and hurtling cars
				The Dioscurian songs divine
				That lighten all the world with lightning of their line.
			
			
			
				49
				
				He sang the last of Homer, having sung
				The last of his Ulysses. Bright and wide
				For him time's dark strait ways, like clouds that clung
				About the day-star, doubtful to divide,
				Waxed in his spiritual eyeshot, and his tongue
				Spake as his soul bore witness, that descried,
				Like those twin towering lights in darkness hung,
				Homer, and grey Laertes at his side
				Kingly as kings are none
				Beneath a later sun,
				And the sweet maiden ministering in pride
				To sovereign and to sage
				In their more sweet old age:
				These things he sang, himself as old, and died.
				And if death be not, if life be,
				As Homer and as Milton are in heaven is he.
			
			
				50
				Poet whose large-eyed loyalty of love
				Was pure toward all high poets, all their kind
				And all bright words and all sweet works thereof;
				Strong like the sun, and like the sunlight kind;
				Heart that no fear but every grief might move
				Wherewith men's hearts were bound of powers that bind;
				The purest soul that ever proof could prove
				From taint of tortuous or of envious mind;
				Whose eyes elate and clear
				Nor shame nor ever fear
				But only pity or glorious wrath could blind;
				
				Name set for love apart,
				Held lifelong in my heart,
				Face like a father's toward my face inclined;
				No gifts like thine are mine to give,
				Who by thine own words only bid thee hail, and live.
