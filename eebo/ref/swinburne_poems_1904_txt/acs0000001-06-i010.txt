            To Isabel Swinburne
            
                The far green westward heavens are bland,
                The far green Wiltshire downs are clear
                As these deep meadows hard at hand:
                The sight knows hardly far from near,
                Nor morning joy from evening cheer.
                In cottage garden-plots their bees
                Find many a fervent flower to seize
                And strain and drain the heart away
                From ripe sweet-williams and sweet-peas
                At every turn on every way.
            
            
                But gladliest seems one flower to expand
                Its whole sweet heart all round us here;
                'Tis Heartsease Country, Pansy Land.
                Nor sounds nor savours harsh and drear
                Where engines yell and halt and veer
                Can vex the sense of him who sees
                One flower-plot midway, that for trees
                Has poles, and sheds all grimed or grey
                For bowers like those that take the breeze
                At every turn on every way.
            
            
            
                Content even there they smile and stand,
                Sweet thought's heart-easing flowers, nor fear,
                With reek and roaring steam though fanned,
                Nor shrink nor perish as they peer.
                The heart's eye holds not those more dear
                That glow between the lanes and leas
                Where'er the homeliest hand may please
                To bid them blossom as they may
                Where light approves and wind agrees
                At every turn on every way.
            
            
                Sister, the word of winds and seas
                Endures not as the word of these
                Your wayside flowers whose breath would say
                How hearts that love may find heart's ease
                At every turn on every way.
