						    Of Memnon or of Janus, half with night
						    Veiled, and fast bound with iron; half with light
							Crowned, holding all men's future in his hand.
						
						
							And all the old westward face of time grown grey
							Was writ with cursing and inscribed for death;
							But on the face that met the mornings breath
							Fear died of hope as darkness dies of day.
