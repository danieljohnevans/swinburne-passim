                A little marsh-plant, yellow green,
                And pricked at lip with tender red.
                Tread close, and either way you tread
                Some faint black water jets between
                Lest you should bruise the curious head.
            
            
                A live thing maybe; who shall know?
                The summer knows and suffers it;
                For the cool moss is thick and sweet
                Each side, and saves the blossom so
                That it lives out the long June heat.
            
            
                The deep scent of the heather burns
                About it; breathless though it be,
                Bow down and worship; more than we
                Is the least flower whose life returns,
                Least weed renascent in the sea.
            
            
                We are vexed and cumbered in earth’s sight
                With wants, with many memories;
                These see their mother what she is,
                Glad-growing, till August leave more bright
                The apple-coloured cranberries.
            
            
            
                Wind blows and bleaches the strong grass,
                Blown all one way to shelter it
                From trample of strayed kine, with feet
                Felt heavier than the moorhen was,
                Strayed up past patches of wild wheat.
            
            
                You call it sundew: how it grows,
                If with its colour it have breath,
                If life taste sweet to it, if death
                Pain its soft petal, no man knows:
                Man has no sight or sense that saith.
            
            
                My sundew, grown of gentle days,
                In these green miles the spring begun
                Thy growth ere April had half done
                With the soft secret of her ways
                Or June made ready for the sun.
            
            
                O red-lipped mouth of marsh-flower,
                I have a secret halved with thee.
                The name that is love’s name to me
                Thou knowest, and the face of her
                Who is my festival to see.
            
            
                The hard sun, as thy petals knew,
                Coloured the heavy moss-water:
                Thou wert not worth green midsummer
                Nor fit to live to August blue,
                O sundew, not remembering her.
