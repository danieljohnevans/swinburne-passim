                Who may praise her?
                Eyes where midnight shames the sun,
                Hair of night and sunshine spun,
                Woven of dawn's or twilight's loom,
                Radiant darkness, lustrous gloom,
                Godlike childhood's flowerlike bloom,
                None may praise aright, nor sing
                Half the grace wherewith like spring
                Love arrays her.

                Love untold
                Sings in silence, speaks in light
                Shed from each fair feature, bright
                Still from heaven, whence toward us, now
                Nine years since, she deigned to bow
                Down the brightness of her brow,
                Deigned to pass through mortal birth:
                Reverence calls her, here on earth,
                Nine years old.

                Love's deep duty,
                Even when love transfigured grows
                Worship, all too surely knows
                How, though love may cast out fear,
                Yet the debt divine and dear
                Due to childhood's godhead here
                May by love of man be paid
                Never; never song be made
                Worth its beauty.

                Nought is all
                Sung or said or dreamed or thought
                Ever, set beside it; nought
                All the love that man may giveâ€”
                Love whose prayer should be, Forgive!
                Heaven, we see, on earth may live;
                Earth can thank not heaven, we know,
                Save with songs that ebb and flow,
                Rise and fall.

                No man living,
                No man dead, save haply one
                Now gone homeward past the sun,
                Ever found such grace as might
                Tune his tongue to praise aright
                Children, flowers of love and light,
                Whom our praise dispraises: we
                Sing, in sooth, but not as he
                Sang thanksgiving.

                Hope that smiled,
                Seeing her new-born beauty, made
                Out of heaven's own light and shade,
                Smiled not half so sweetly: love,
                Seeing the sun, afar above,
                Warm the nest that rears the dove,
                Sees, more bright than moon or sun,
                All the heaven of heavens in one
                Little child.

                Who may sing her?
                Wings of angels when they stir
                Make no music worthy her:
                Sweeter sound her shy soft words
                Here than songs of God's own birds
                Whom the fire of rapture girds
                Round with light from love's face lit;
                Hands of angels find no fit
                Gifts to bring her.

                Babes at birth
                Wear as raiment round them cast,
                Keep as witness toward their past,
                Tokens left of heaven; and each,
                Ere its lips learn mortal speech,
                Ere sweet heaven pass on pass reach,
                Bears in undiverted eyes
                Proof of unforgotten skies
                Here on earth.

                Quenched as embers
                Quenched with flakes of rain or snow
                Till the last faint flame burns low,
                All those lustrous memories lie
                Dead with babyhood gone by:
                Yet in her they dare not die:
                Others, fair as heaven is, yet,
                Now they share not heaven, forget:
                She remembers.
