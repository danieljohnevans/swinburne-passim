            1890
            
                I
                
                Out of hell a word comes hissing, dark as doom,
                
                Fierce as fire, and foul as plague-polluted gloom;
                Out of hell wherein the sinless damned endure
                More than ever sin conceived of pains impure;
                More than ever ground men's living souls to dust;
                Worse than madness ever dreamed of murderous lust.
                Since the world's wail first went up from lands and seas
                Ears have heard not, tongues have told not things like these.
                Dante, led by love's and hate's accordant spell
                Down the deepest and the loathliest ways of hell,
                Where beyond the brook of blood the rain was fire,
                Where the scalps were masked with dung more deep than mire,
                Saw not, where the filth was foulest, and the night
                Darkest, depths whose fiends could match the Muscovite.
                Set beside this truth, his deadliest vision seems
                Pale and pure and painless as a virgin's dreams.
                
                Maidens dead beneath the clasping lash, and wives
                Rent with deadlier pangs than death—for shame survives,
                Naked, mad, starved, scourged, spurned, frozen, fallen, deflowered,
                Souls and bodies as by fangs of beasts devoured,
                Sounds that hell would hear not, sights no thought could shape,
                Limbs that feel as flame the ravenous grasp of rape,
                Filth of raging crime and shame that crime enjoys,
                Age made one with youth in torture, girls with boys,
                These, and worse if aught be worse than these things are,
                Prove thee regent, Russia—praise thy mercy, Czar.
            
            
                II
                Sons of man, men born of women, may we dare
                Say they sin who dare be slain and dare not spare?
                They who take their lives in hand and smile on death,
                Holding life as less than sleep's most fitful breath,
                So their life perchance or death may serve and speed
                Faith and hope, that die if dream become not deed?
                Nought is death and nought is life and nought is fate
                Save for souls that love has clothed with fire of hate.
                These behold them, weigh them, prove them, find them nought,
                Save by light of hope and fire of burning thought.
                What though sun be less than storm where these aspire,
                Dawn than lightning, song than thunder, light than fire?
                Help is none in heaven: hope sees no gentler star:
                Earth is hell, and hell bows down before the Czar.
                
                All its monstrous, murderous, lecherous births acclaim
                Him whose empire lives to match its fiery fame.
                Nay, perchance at sight or sense of deeds here done,
                Here where men may lift up eyes to greet the sun,
                Hell recoils heart-stricken: horror worse than hell
                Darkens earth and sickens heaven; life knows the spell,
                Shudders, quails, and sinks—or, filled with fierier breath,
                Rises red in arms devised of darkling death.
                Pity mad with passion, anguish mad with shame,
                Call aloud on justice by her darker name;
                Love grows hate for love's sake; life takes death for guide.
                Night hath none but one red star—Tyrannicide.
            
            
                III
                God or man, be swift; hope sickens with delay:
                Smite, and send him howling down his father's way!
                Fall, O fire of heaven, and smite as fire from hell
                Halls wherein men's torturers, crowned and cowering, dwell!
                These that crouch and shrink and shudder, girt with power—
                These that reign, and dare not trust one trembling hour—
                These omnipotent, whom terror curbs and drives—
                These whose life reflects in fear their victims' lives—
                These whose breath sheds poison worse than plague's thick breath—
                These whose reign is ruin, these whose word is death,
                
                These whose will turns heaven to hell, and day to night,
                These, if God's hand smite not, how shall man's not smite?
                So from hearts by horror withered as by fire
                Surge the strains of unappeasable desire;
                Sounds that bid the darkness lighten, lit for death;
                Bid the lips whose breath was doom yield up their breath;
                Down the way of Czars, awhile in vain deferred,
                Bid the Second Alexander light the Third.
                How for shame shall men rebuke them? how may we
                Blame, whose fathers died, and slew, to leave us free?
                We, though all the world cry out upon them, know,
                Were our strife as theirs, we could not strike but so;
                Could not cower, and could not kiss the hands that smite;
                Could not meet them armed in sunlit battle's light.
                Dark as fear and red as hate though morning rise,
                Life it is that conquers; death it is that dies.
