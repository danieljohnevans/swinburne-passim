                When I had wings, my brother,
                Such wings were mine as thine:
                Such life my heart remembers
                In all as wild Septembers
                As this when life seems other,
                Though sweet, than once was mine;
                When I had wings, my brother,
                Such wings were mine as thine.
            
            
                Such life as thrills and quickens
                The silence of thy flight,
                Or fills thy note's elation
                With lordlier exultation
                Than man's, whose faint heart sickens
                With hopes and fears that blight
                Such life as thrills and quickens
                The silence of thy flight.
            
            
                Thy cry from windward clanging
                Makes all the cliffs rejoice;
                Though storm clothe seas with sorrow,
                Thy call salutes the morrow;
                While shades of pain seem hanging
                Round earth's most rapturous voice,
                Thy cry from windward clanging
                Makes all the cliffs rejoice.
            
            
            
                We, sons and sires of seamen,
                Whose home is all the sea,
                What place man may, we claim it;
                But thine—whose thought may name it?
                Free birds live higher than freemen,
                And gladlier ye than we—
                We, sons and sires of seamen,
                Whose home is all the sea.
            
            
                For you the storm sounds only
                More notes of more delight
                Than earth's in sunniest weather:
                When heaven and sea together
                Join strengths against the lonely
                Lost bark borne down by night,
                For you the storm sounds only
                More notes of more delight.
            
            
                With wider wing, and louder
                Long clarion-call of joy,
                Thy tribe salutes the terror
                Of darkness, wild as error,
                But sure as truth, and prouder
                Than waves with man for toy;
                With wider wing, and louder
                Long clarion-call of joy.
            
            
                The wave's wing spreads and flutters,
                The wave's heart swells and breaks;
                One moment's passion thrills it,
                One pulse of power fulfils it
                And ends the pride it utters
                When, loud with life that quakes,
                The wave's wing spreads and flutters,
                The wave's heart swells and breaks.
            
            
            
                But thine and thou, my brother,
                Keep heart and wing more high
                Than aught may scare or sunder;
                The waves whose throats are thunder
                Fall hurtling each on other,
                And triumph as they die;
                But thine and thou, my brother,
                Keep heart and wing more high.
            
            
                More high than wrath or anguish,
                More strong than pride or fear,
                The sense or soul half hidden
                In thee, for us forbidden,
                Bids thee nor change nor languish,
                But live thy life as here,
                More high than wrath or anguish,
                More strong than pride or fear.
            
            
                We are fallen, even we, whose passion
                On earth is nearest thine;
                Who sing, and cease from flying;
                Who live, and dream of dying:
                Grey time, in time's grey fashion,
                Bids wingless creatures pine:
                We are fallen, even we, whose passion
                On earth is nearest thine.
            
            
                The lark knows no such rapture,
                Such joy no nightingale,
                As sways the songless measure
                Wherein thy wings take pleasure:
                Thy love may no man capture,
                Thy pride may no man quail;
                The lark knows no such rapture,
                Such joy no nightingale.
            
            
            
                And we, whom dreams embolden,
                We can but creep and sing
                And watch through heaven's waste hollow
                The flight no sight may follow
                To the utter bourne beholden
                Of none that lack thy wing:
                And we, whom dreams embolden,
                We can but creep and sing.
            
            
                Our dreams have wings that falter,
                Our hearts bear hopes that die;
                For thee no dream could better
                A life no fears may fetter,
                A pride no care can alter,
                That wots not whence or why
                Our dreams have wings that falter,
                Our hearts bear hopes that die.
            
            
                With joy more fierce and sweeter
                Than joys we deem divine
                Their lives, by time untarnished,
                Are girt about and garnished,
                Who match the wave's full metre
                And drink the wind's wild wine
                With joy more fierce and sweeter
                Than joys we deem divine.
            
            
                Ah, well were I for ever,
                Wouldst thou change lives with me,
                And take my song's wild honey,
                And give me back thy sunny
                Wide eyes that weary never,
                And wings that search the sea;
                Ah, well were I for ever,
                Wouldst thou change lives with me.
