				                TO
				                
				                    Edward
				                    John
				                    Trelawny
				                
				            
				            
				                A sea-mew on a sea-king's wrist alighting,
				                As the north sea-wind caught and strained and curled
				                The raven-figured flag that led men fighting
				                From field to green field of the water-world,
				                Might find such brief high favour at his hand
				                For wings imbrued with brine, with foam impearled,
				                As these my songs require at yours on land,
				                That durst not save for love's free sake require,
				                Being lightly born between the foam and sand,
				                But reared by hope and memory and desire
				                Of lives that were and life that is to be,
				                Even such as filled his heavenlier song with fire
				                Whose very voice, that sang to set man free,
				                Was in your ears as ever in ours his lyre,
				                Once, ere the flame received him from the sea.
