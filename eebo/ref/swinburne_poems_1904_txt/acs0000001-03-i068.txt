                Baby, see the flowers!
                —Baby sees
                Fairer things than these,
                Fairer though they be than dreams of ours.
            
            
                Baby, hear the birds!
                —Baby knows
                Better songs than those,
                Sweeter though they sound than sweetest words.
            
            
                Baby, see the moon!
                —Baby's eyes
                Laugh to watch it rise,
                Answering light with love and night with noon.
            
            
                Baby, hear the sea!
                —Baby's face
                Takes a graver grace,
                Touched with wonder what the sound may be.
            
            
                Baby, see the star!
                —Baby's hand
                Opens, warm and bland,
                Calm in claim of all things fair that are.
            
            
            
                Baby, hear the bells!
                —Baby's head
                Bows, as ripe for bed,
                Now the flowers curl round and close their cells.
            
            
                Baby, flower of light,
                Sleep, and see
                Brighter dreams than we,
                Till good day shall smile away good night.
