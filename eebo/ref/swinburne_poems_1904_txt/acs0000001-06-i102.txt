                Death, winged with fire of hate from deathless hell
                Wherein the souls of anarchs hiss and die,
                With stroke as dire has cloven a heart as high
                As twice beyond the wide sea's westward swell
                The living lust of death had power to quell
                Through ministry of murderous hands whereby
                Dark fate bade Lincoln's head and Garfield's lie
                Low even as his who bids his France farewell.
            
            
                France, now no heart that would not weep with thee
                Loved ever faith or freedom. From thy hand
                The staff of state is broken: hope, unmanned
                With anguish, doubts if freedom's self be free.
                The snake-souled anarch's fang strikes all the land
                Cold, and all hearts unsundered by the sea.
            
            June 25, 1894.
