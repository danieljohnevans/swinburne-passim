            Three Sonnets to his Memory
            I 
                The stainless soul that smiled through glorious eyes; 
                The bright grave brow whereon dark fortune's blast
                Might blow, but might not bend it, nor o'ercast,
                Save for one fierce fleet hour of shame, the skies
                Thrilled with warm dreams of worthier days to rise
                And end the whole world's winter; here at last,
                If death be death, have passed into the past;
                If death be life, live, though their semblance dies.
                Hope and high faith inviolate of distrust
                Shone strong as life inviolate of the grave
                Through each bright word and lineament serene.
                Most loving righteousness and love most just
                Crowned, as day crowns the dawn-enkindled wave,
                With visible aureole thine unfaltering mien.
            
            
                II 
                Strong time and fire-swift change, with lightnings clad
                And shod with thunders of reverberate years,
                Have filled with light and sound of hopes and fears
                The space of many a season, since I had
                
                Grace of good hap to make my spirit glad,
                Once communing with thine: and memory hears
                The bright voice yet that then rejoiced mine ears,
                Sees yet the light of eyes that spake, and bade
                Fear not, but hope, though then time's heart were weak
                And heaven by hell shade-stricken, and the range
                Of high-born hope made questionable and strange
                As twilight trembling till the sunlight speak.
                Thou sawest the sunrise and the storm in one
                Break: seest thou now the storm-compelling sun?
            
            
                III 
                Surely thou seest, O spirit of light and fire,
                Surely thou canst not choose, O soul, but see
                The days whose dayspring was beheld of thee
                Ere eyes less pure might have their hope's desire,
                Beholding life in heaven again respire
                Where men saw nought that was or was to be,
                Save only death imperial. Thou and he
                Who has the heart of all men's hearts for lyre,
                Ye twain, being great of spirit as time is great,
                And sure of sight as truth's own heavenward eye,
                Beheld the forms of forces passing by
                And certitude of equal-balanced fate,
                Whose breath forefelt makes darkness palpitate,
                And knew that light should live and darkness die.
