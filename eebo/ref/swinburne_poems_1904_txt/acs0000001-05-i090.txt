    					Upon the borderlands of being,
    					
    					Where life draws hardly breath
    					Between the lights and shadows fleeing
    					Fast as a word one saith,
    					Two flowers rejoice our eyesight, seeing
    					The dawns of birth and death.
    				
    				
    					Behind the babe his dawn is lying
    					Half risen with notes of mirth
    					From all the winds about it flying
    					Through new-born heaven and earth:
    					Before bright age his day for dying
    					Dawns equal-eyed with birth.
    				
    				
    					Equal the dews of even and dawn,
    					Equal the sun's eye seen
    					A hand's breadth risen and half withdrawn:
    					But no bright hour between
    					Brings aught so bright by stream or lawn
    					To noonday growths of green.
    				
    				
    					Which flower of life may smell the sweeter
    					To love's insensual sense,
    					Which fragrance move with offering meeter
    					His soothed omnipotence,
    					Being chosen as fairer or as fleeter,
    					Borne hither or borne hence,
    				
    				
    				
    					Love's foiled omniscience knows not: this
    					Were more than all he knows
    					With all his lore of bale and bliss,
    					The choice of rose and rose,
    					One red as lips that touch with his,
    					One white as moonlit snows.
    				
    				
    					No hope is half so sweet and good,
    					No dream of saint or sage
    					So fair as these are: no dark mood
    					But these might best assuage;
    					The sweet red rose of babyhood,
    					The white sweet rose of age.
