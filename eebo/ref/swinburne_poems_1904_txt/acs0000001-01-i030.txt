                I
                
                    White rose in red rose-garden
                    Is not so white;
                    Snowdrops that plead for pardon
                    And pine for fright
                    Because the hard East blows
                    Over their maiden rows
                    Grow not as this face grows from pale to bright.
                
                
                    Behind the veil, forbidden,
                    Shut up from sight,
                    Love, is there sorrow hidden,
                    Is there delight?
                    Is joy thy dower or grief,
                    White rose of weary leaf,
                    Late rose whose life is brief, whose loves are light?
                
                
                    Soft snows that hard winds harden
                    Till each flake bite
                    Fill all the flowerless garden
                    Whose flowers took flight
                    
                    Long since when summer ceased,
                    And men rose up from feast,
                    And warm west wind grew east, and warm day night.
                
            
            
                II
                
                    "Come snow, come wind or thunder
                    High up in air,
                    I watch my face, and wonder
                    At my bright hair;
                    Nought else exalts or grieves
                    The rose at heart, that heaves
                    With love of her own leaves and lips that pair.
                
                
                    "She knows not loves that kissed her
                    She knows not where.
                    Art thou the ghost, my sister,
                    White sister there,
                    Am I the ghost, who knows?
                    My hand, a fallen rose,
                    Lies snow-white on white snows, and takes no care.
                
                
                    "I cannot see what pleasures
                    Or what pains were;
                    What pale new loves and treasures
                    New years will bear;
                    What beam will fall, what shower,
                    What grief or joy for dower;
                    But one thing knows the flower; the flower is fair."
                
            
            
            
                III
                
                    Glad, but not flushed with gladness,
                    Since joys go by;
                    Sad, but not bent with sadness,
                    Since sorrows die;
                    Deep in the gleaming glass
                    She sees all past things pass,
                    And all sweet life that was lie down and lie.
                
                
                    There glowing ghosts of flowers
                    Draw down, draw nigh;
                    And wings of swift spent hours
                    Take flight and fly;
                    She sees by formless gleams,
                    She hears across cold streams,
                    Dead mouths of many dreams that sing and sigh.
                
                
                    Face fallen and white throat lifted,
                    With sleepless eye
                    She sees old loves that drifted,
                    She knew not why,
                    Old loves and faded fears
                    Float down a stream that hears
                    The flowing of all menâ€™s tears beneath the sky.
