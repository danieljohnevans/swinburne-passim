                Babe, if rhyme be none
                For that sweet small word
                Babe, the sweetest one
                Ever heard,
            
            
                Right it is and meet
                Rhyme should keep not true
                Time with such a sweet
                Thing as you.
            
            
                Meet it is that rhyme
                Should not gain such grace:
                What is April's prime
                To your face?
            
            
                What to yours is May's
                Rosiest smile? what sound
                Like your laughter sways
                All hearts round?
            
            
                None can tell in metre
                Fit for ears on earth
                What sweet star grew sweeter
                At your birth.
            
            
            
                Wisdom doubts what may be:
                Hope, with smile sublime,
                Trusts: but neither, baby,
                Knows the rhyme.
            
            
                Wisdom lies down lonely;
                Hope keeps watch from far;
                None but one seer only
                Sees the star.
            
            
                Love alone, with yearning
                Heart for astrolabe,
                Takes the star's height, burning
                O'er the babe.
