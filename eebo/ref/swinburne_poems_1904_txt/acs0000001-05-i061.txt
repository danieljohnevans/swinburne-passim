                				Strong as death, and cruel as the grave,
                				Clothed with cloud and tempest's blackening breath,
                				Known of death's dread self, whom none outbrave,
                				Strong as death,
                			
                			
                				Love, brow-bound with anguish for a wreath,
                				Fierce with pain, a tyrant-hearted slave,
                				Burns above a world that groans beneath.
                			
                			
                				Hath not pity power on thee to save,
                				Love? hath power no pity? Nought he saith,
                				Answering: blind he walks as wind or wave,
                				Strong as death.
