                Northumberland, so proud and sad to-day,
                Weep and rejoice, our mother, whom no son
                More glorious than this dead and deathless one
                Brought ever fame whereon no time shall prey.
                Nor heed we more than he what liars dare say
                Of mercy's holiest duties left undone
                Toward whelps and dams of murderous foes, whom none
                Save we had spared or feared to starve and slay.
            
            
                Alone as Milton and as Wordsworth found
                And hailed their England, when from all around
                Howled all the recreant hate of envious knaves,
                Sublime she stands: while, stifled in the sound,
                Each lie that falls from German boors and slaves
                Falls but as filth dropt in the wandering waves.
            
            November 4, 1901.
