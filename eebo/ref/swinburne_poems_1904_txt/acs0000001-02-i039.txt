				Between the wave-ridge and the strand
				I let you forth in sight of land,
				Songs that with storm-crossed wings and eyes
				Strain eastward till the darkness dies;
				Let signs and beacons fall or stand,
				And stars and balefires set and rise;
				Ye, till some lordlier lyric hand
				Weave the beloved brows their crown,
				At the beloved feet lie down.
			
			
				O, whatsoever of life or light
				Love hath to give you, what of might
				Or heart or hope is yours to live,
				I charge you take in trust to give
				For very love's sake, in whose sight,
				Through poise of hours alternative
				And seasons plumed with light or night,
				Ye live and move and have your breath
				To sing with on the ridge of death.
			
			
				I charge you faint not all night through
				For love's sake that was breathed on you
				To be to you as wings and feet
				For travel, and as blood to heat
				And sense of spirit to renew
				
				And bloom of fragrance to keep sweet
				And fire of purpose to keep true
				The life, if life in such things be,
				That I would give you forth of me.
			
			
				Out where the breath of war may bear,
				Out in the rank moist reddened air
				That sounds and smells of death, and hath
				No light but death's upon its path
				Seen through the black wind's tangled hair,
				I send you past the wild time's wrath
				To find his face who bade you bear
				Fruit of his seed to faith and love,
				That he may take the heart thereof.
			
			
				By day or night, by sea or street,
				Fly till ye find and clasp his feet
				And kiss as worshippers who bring
				Too much love on their lips to sing,
				But with hushed heads accept and greet
				The presence of some heavenlier thing
				In the near air; so may ye meet
				His eyes, and droop not utterly
				For shame's sake at the light you see.
			
			
				Not utterly struck spiritless
				For shame's sake and unworthiness
				Of these poor forceless hands that come
				Empty, these lips that should be dumb,
				This love whose seal can but impress
				These weak word-offerings wearisome
				Whose blessings have not strength to bless
				Nor lightnings fire to burn up aught
				Nor smite with thunders of their thought.
			
			
			
				One thought they have, even love; one light,
				Truth, that keeps clear the sun by night;
				One chord, of faith as of a lyre;
				One heat, of hope as of a fire;
				One heart, one music, and one might,
				One flame, one altar, and one choir;
				And one man's living head in sight
				Who said, when all time's sea was foam,
				Let there be Rome â€” and there was Rome.
			
			
				As a star set in space for token
				Like a live word of God's mouth spoken,
				Visible sound, light audible,
				In the great darkness thick as hell
				A stanchless flame of love unsloken,
				A sign to conquer and compel,
				A law to stand in heaven unbroken
				Whereby the sun shines, and wherethrough
				Time's eldest empires are made new;
			
			
				So rose up on our generations
				That light of the most ancient nations,
				Law, life, and light, on the world's way,
				The very God of very day,
				The sun-god; from their star-like stations
				Far down the night in disarray
				Fled, crowned with fires of tribulations,
				The suns of sunless years, whose light
				And life and law were of the night.
			
			
				The naked kingdoms quenched and stark
				Drave with their dead things down the dark,
				Helmless; their whole world, throne by throne,
				Fell, and its whole heart turned to stone,
				
				Hopeless; their hands that touched our ark
				Withered; and lo, aloft, alone,
				On time's white waters man's one bark,
				Where the red sundawn's open eye
				Lit the soft gulf of low green sky.
			
			
				So for a season piloted
				It sailed the sunlight, and struck red
				With fire of dawn reverberate
				The wan face of incumbent fate
				That paused half pitying overhead
				And almost had foregone the freight
				Of those dark hours the next day bred
				For shame, and almost had forsworn
				Service of night for love of morn.
			
			
				Then broke the whole night in one blow,
				Thundering; then all hell with one throe
				Heaved, and brought forth beneath the stroke
				Death; and all dead things moved and woke
				That the dawn's arrows had brought low,
				At the great sound of night that broke
				Thundering, and all the old world-wide woe;
				And under night's loud-sounding dome
				Men sought her, and she was not Rome.
			
			
				Still with blind hands and robes blood-wet
				Night hangs on heaven, reluctant yet,
				With black blood dripping from her eyes
				On the soiled lintels of the skies,
				With brows and lips that thirst and threat,
				Heart-sick with fear lest the sun rise,
				And aching with her fires that set,
				And shuddering ere dawn bursts her bars,
				Burns out with all her beaten stars.
			
			
			
				In this black wind of war they fly
				Now, ere that hour be in the sky
				That brings back hope, and memory back,
				And light and law to lands that lack;
				That spiritual sweet hour whereby
				The bloody-handed night and black
				Shall be cast out of heaven to die;
				Kingdom by kingdom, crown by crown,
				The fires of darkness are blown down.
			
			
				Yet heavy, grievous yet the weight
				Sits on us of imperfect fate.
				From wounds of other days and deeds
				Still this day's breathing body bleeds;
				Still kings for fear and slaves for hate
				Sow lives of men on earth like seeds
				In the red soil they saturate;
				And we, with faces eastward set,
				Stand sightless of the morning yet.
			
			
				And many for pure sorrow's sake
				Look back and stretch back hands to take
				Gifts of night's giving, ease and sleep,
				Flowers of night's grafting, strong to steep
				The soul in dreams it will not break,
				Songs of soft hours that sigh and sweep
				Its lifted eyelids nigh to wake
				With subtle plumes and lulling breath
				That soothe its weariness to death.
			
			
				And many, called of hope and pride,
				Fall ere the sunrise from our side.
				Fresh lights and rumours of fresh fames
				That shift and veer by night like flames,
				
				Shouts and blown trumpets, ghosts that glide
				Calling, and hail them by dead names,
				Fears, angers, memories, dreams divide
				Spirit from spirit, and wear out
				Strong hearts of men with hope and doubt.
			
			
				Till time beget and sorrow bear
				The soul-sick eyeless child despair,
				That comes among us, mad and blind,
				With counsels of a broken mind,
				Tales of times dead and woes that were,
				And, prophesying against mankind,
				Shakes out the horror of her hair
				To take the sunlight with its coils
				And hold the living soul in toils.
			
			
				By many ways of death and moods
				Souls pass into their servitudes.
				Their young wings weaken, plume by plume
				Drops, and their eyelids gather gloom
				And close against man's frauds and feuds,
				And their tongues call they know not whom
				To help in their vicissitudes;
				For many slaveries are, but one
				Liberty, single as the sun.
			
			
				One light, one law, that burns up strife,
				And one sufficiency of life.
				Self-stablished, the sufficing soul
				Hears the loud wheels of changes roll,
				Sees against man man bare the knife,
				Sees the world severed, and is whole;
				Sees force take dowerless fraud to wife,
				And fear from fraud's incestuous bed
				Crawl forth and smite his father dead:
			
			
			
				Sees death made drunk with war, sees time
				Weave many-coloured crime with crime,
				State overthrown on ruining state,
				And dares not be disconsolate.
				Only the soul hath feet to climb,
				Only the soul hath room to wait,
				Hath brows and eyes to hold sublime
				Above all evil and all good,
				All strength and all decrepitude.
			
			
				She only, she since earth began,
				The many-minded soul of man,
				From one incognizable root
				That bears such divers-coloured fruit,
				Hath ruled for blessing or for ban
				The flight of seasons and pursuit;
				She regent, she republican,
				With wide and equal eyes and wings
				Broods on things born and dying things.
			
			
				Even now for love or doubt of us
				The hour intense and hazardous
				Hangs high with pinions vibrating
				Whereto the light and darkness cling,
				Dividing the dim season thus,
				And shakes from one ambiguous wing
				Shadow, and one is luminous,
				And day falls from it; so the past
				Torments the future to the last.
			
			
				And we that cannot hear or see
				The sounds and lights of liberty,
				The witness of the naked God
				That treads on burning hours unshod
				
				With instant feet unwounded; we
				That can trace only where he trod
				By fire in heaven or storm at sea,
				Not know the very present whole
				And naked nature of the soul;
			
			
				We that see wars and woes and kings,
				And portents of enormous things,
				Empires, and agonies, and slaves,
				And whole flame of town-swallowing graves;
				That hear the harsh hours clap sharp wings
				Above the roar of ranks like waves,
				From wreck to wreck as the world swings;
				Know but that men there are who see
				And hear things other far than we.
			
			
				By the light sitting on their brows,
				The fire wherewith their presence glows,
				The music falling with their feet,
				The sweet sense of a spirit sweet
				That with their speech or motion grows
				And breathes and burns men's hearts with heat;
				By these signs there is none but knows
				Men who have life and grace to give,
				Men who have seen the soul and live.
			
			
				By the strength sleeping in their eyes,
				The lips whereon their sorrow lies
				Smiling, the lines of tears unshed,
				The large divine look of one dead
				That speaks out of the breathless skies
				In silence, when the light is shed
				Upon man's soul of memories;
				The supreme look that sets love free,
				The look of stars and of the sea;
			
			
			
				By the strong patient godhead seen
				Implicit in their mortal mien,
				The conscience of a God held still
				And thunders ruled by their own will
				And fast-bound fires that might burn clean
				This worldly air that foul things fill,
				And the afterglow of what has been,
				That, passing, shows us without word
				What they have seen, what they have heard;
			
			
				By all these keen and burning signs
				The spirit knows them and divines.
				In bonds, in banishment, in grief,
				Scoffed at and scourged with unbelief,
				Foiled with false trusts and thwart designs,
				Stripped of green days and hopes in leaf,
				Their mere bare body of glory shines
				Higher, and man gazing surelier sees
				What light, what comfort is of these.
			
			
				So I now gazing; till the sense
				Being set on fire of confidence
				Strains itself sunward, feels out far
				Beyond the bright and morning star,
				Beyond the extreme wave's refluence,
				To where the fierce first sunbeams are
				Whose fire intolerant and intense
				As birthpangs whence day burns to be
				Parts breathless heaven from breathing sea.
			
			
				I see not, know not, and am blest,
				Master, who know that thou knowest,
				Dear lord and leader, at whose hand
				The first days and the last days stand,
				
				With scars and crowns on head and breast,
				That fought for love of the sweet land
				Or shall fight in her latter quest;
				All the days armed and girt and crowned
				Whose glories ring thy glory round.
			
			
				Thou sawest, when all the world was blind,
				The light that should be of mankind,
				The very day that was to be;
				And how shalt thou not sometime see
				Thy city perfect to thy mind
				Stand face to living face with thee,
				And no miscrowned man's head behind;
				The hearth of man, the human home,
				The central flame that shall be Rome?
			
			
				As one that ere a June day rise
				Makes seaward for the dawn, and tries
				The water with delighted limbs
				That taste the sweet dark sea, and swims
				Right eastward under strengthening skies,
				And sees the gradual rippling rims
				Of waves whence day breaks blossom-wise
				Take fire ere light peer well above,
				And laughs from all his heart with love;
			
			
				And softlier swimming with raised head
				Feels the full flower of morning shed
				And fluent sunrise round him rolled
				That laps and laves his body bold
				With fluctuant heaven in water's stead,
				And urgent through the growing gold
				Strikes, and sees all the spray flash red,
				And his soul takes the sun, and yearns
				For joy wherewith the sea's heart burns;
			
			
			
				So the soul seeking through the dark
				Heavenward, a dove without an ark,
				Transcends the unnavigable sea
				Of years that wear out memory;
				So calls, a sunward-singing lark,
				In the ear of souls that should be free;
				So points them toward the sun for mark
				Who steer not for the stress of waves,
				And seek strange helmsmen, and are slaves.
			
			
				For if the swimmer's eastward eye
				Must see no sunrise â€” must put by
				The hope that lifted him and led
				Once, to have light about his head,
				To see beneath the clear low sky
				The green foam-whitened wave wax red
				And all the morning's banner fly â€”
				Then, as earth's helpless hopes go down,
				Let earth's self in the dark tides drown.
			
			
				Yea, if no morning must behold
				Man, other than were they now cold,
				And other deeds than past deeds done,
				Nor any near or far-off sun
				Salute him risen and sunlike-souled,
				Free, boundless, fearless, perfect, one,
				Let man's world die like worlds of old,
				And here in heaven's sight only be
				The sole sun on the worldless sea.
