                I
                Thou whose beauty
                Knows no duty
                Due to love that moves thee never;
                Thou whose mercies
                Are men's curses,
                And thy smile a scourge for ever;
            
            
                II
                Thou that givest
                Death and livest
                On the death of thy sweet giving;
                Thou that sparest
                Not nor carest
                Though thy scorn leave no love living;
            
            
                III
                Thou whose rootless
                Flower is fruitless
                As the pride its heart encloses,
                But thine eyes are
                As May skies are,
                And thy words like spoken roses;
            
            
            
                IV
                Thou whose grace is
                In men's faces
                Fierce and wayward as thy will is;
                Thou whose peerless
                Eyes are tearless,
                And thy thoughts as cold sweet lilies;
            
            
                V
                Thou that takest
                Hearts and makest
                Wrecks of loves to strew behind thee,
                Whom the swallow
                Sure should follow,
                Finding summer where we find thee;
            
            
                VI
                Thou that wakest
                Hearts and breakest,
                And thy broken hearts forgive thee,
                That wilt make no
                Pause and take no
                Gift that love for love might give thee;
            
            
                VII
                Thou that bindest
                Eyes and blindest,
                Serving worst who served thee longest;
                Thou that speakest,
                And the weakest
                Heart is his that was the strongest;
            
            
            
                VIII
                Take in season
                Thought with reason;
                Think what gifts are ours for giving;
                Hear what beauty
                Owes of duty
                To the love that keeps it living.
            
            
                IX
                Dust that covers
                Long dead lovers
                Song blows off with breath that brightens;
                At its flashes
                Their white ashes
                Burst in bloom that lives and lightens.
            
            
                X
                Had they bent not
                Head or lent not
                Ear to love and amorous duties,
                Song had never
                Saved for ever,
                Love, the least of all their beauties.
            
            
                XI
                All the golden
                Names of olden
                Women yet by men's love cherished,
                All our dearest
                Thoughts hold nearest,
                Had they loved not, all had perished.
            
            
            
                XII
                If no fruit is
                Of thy beauties,
                Tell me yet, since none may win them,
                What and wherefore
                Love should care for
                Of all good things hidden in them?
            
            
                XIII
                Pain for profit
                Comes but of it,
                If the lips that lure their lover's
                Hold no treasure
                Past the measure
                Of the lightest hour that hovers.
            
            
                XIV
                If they give not
                Or forgive not
                Gifts or thefts for grace or guerdon,
                Love that misses
                Fruit of kisses
                Long will bear no thankless burden.
            
            
                XV
                If they care not
                Though love were not,
                If no breath of his burn through then,
                Joy must borrow
                Song from sorrow,
                Fear teach hope the way to woo them.
            
            
            
                XVI
                Grief has measures
                Soft as pleasure's,
                Fear has moods that hope lies deep in,
                Songs to sing him,
                Dreams to bring him,
                And a red-rose bed to sleep in.
            
            
                XVII
                Hope with fearless
                Looks and tearless
                Lies and laughs too near the thunder;
                Fear hath sweeter
                Speech and meeter
                For heart's love to hide him under.
            
            
                XVIII
                Joy by daytime
                Fills his playtime
                Full of songs loud mirth takes pride in;
                Night and morrow
                Weave round sorrow
                Thoughts as soft as sleep to hide in.
            
            
                XIX
                Graceless faces,
                Loveless graces,
                Are but motes in light that quicken,
                Sands that run down
                Ere the sundown,
                Roseleaves dead ere autumn sicken.
            
            
            
                XX
                Fair and fruitless
                Charms are bootless
                Spells to ward off age's peril;
                Lips that give not
                Love shall live not,
                Eyes that meet not eyes are sterile.
            
            
                XXI
                But the beauty
                Bound in duty
                Fast to love that falls off never
                Love shall cherish
                Lest it perish,
                And its root bears fruit for ever.
