    					If childhood were not in the world,
    					
    					But only men and women grown;
    					No baby-locks in tendrils curled,
    					No baby-blossoms blown;
    				
    				
    					Though men were stronger, women fairer,
    					And nearer all delights in reach,
    					And verse and music uttered rarer
    					Tones of more godlike speech;
    				
    				
    					Though the utmost life of life's best hours
    					Found, as it cannot now find, words;
    					Though desert sands were sweet as flower
    					And flowers could sing like birds,
    				
    				
    					But children never heard them, never
    					They felt a child's foot leap and run
    					This were a drearier star than ever
    					Yet looked upon the sun.
