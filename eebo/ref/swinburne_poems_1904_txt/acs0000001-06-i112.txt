                Écrasez l'infâme.—Voltaire
            
            
                Les prêtres ont raison de l'appeler Lucifer.—Victor Hugo
            
            Voltaire, our England's lover, man divine
            Beyond all Gods that ever fear adored
            By right and might, by sceptre and by sword,
            By godlike love of sunlike truth, made thine
            Through godlike hate of falsehood's marshlight shine
            And all the fume of creeds and deeds abhorred
            Whose light was darkness, till the dawn-star soared,
            Truth, reason, mercy, justice, keep thy shrine
            Sacred in memory's temple, seeing that none
            Of all souls born to strive before the sun
            Loved ever good or hated evil more.
            The snake that felt thy heel upon her head,
            Night's first-born, writhes as though she were not dead,
            But strikes not, stings not, slays not as before.
