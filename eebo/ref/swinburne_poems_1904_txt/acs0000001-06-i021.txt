                Sea beyond sea, sand after sweep of sand,
                Here ivory smooth, here cloven and ridged with flow
                Of channelled waters soft as rain or snow,
                Stretch their lone length at ease beneath the bland
                Grey gleam of skies whose smile on wave and strand
                Shines weary like a man's who smiles to know
                That now no dream can mock his faith with show,
                Nor cloud for him seem living sea or land.
            
            
                Is there an end at all of all this waste,
                These crumbling cliffs defeatured and defaced,
                These ruinous heights of sea-sapped walls that slide
                Seaward with all their banks of bleak blown flowers
                Glad yet of life, ere yet their hope subside
                Beneath the coil of dull dense waves and hours?
