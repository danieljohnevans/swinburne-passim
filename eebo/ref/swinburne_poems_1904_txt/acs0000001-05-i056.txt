                				Mad March, with the wind in his wings wide-spread,
                				Leaps from heaven, and the deep dawn's arch
                				Hails re-risen again from the dead
                				Mad March.
                			
                			
                				Soft small flames on rowan and larch
                				Break forth as laughter on lips that said
                				Nought till the pulse in them beat love's march.
                			
                			
                				But the heartbeat now in the lips rose-red
                				Speaks life to the world, and the winds that parch
                				Bring April forth as a bride to wed
                				Mad March.
