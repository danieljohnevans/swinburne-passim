				Men of Eleusis, ye that with long staves
				Sit in the market-houses, and speak words
				Made sweet with wisdom as the rare wine is
				Thickened with honey; and ye sons of these
				Who in the glad thick streets go up and down
				For pastime or grave traffic or mere chance;
				And all fair women having rings of gold
				On hands or hair; and chiefest over these
				I name you, daughters of this man the king,
				Who dipping deep smooth pitchers of pure brass
				Under the bubbled wells, till each round lip
				Stooped with loose gurgle of waters incoming,
				Found me an old sick woman, lamed and lean,
				Beside a growth of builded olive-boughs
				Whence multiplied thick song of thick-plumed throats —
				Also wet tears filled up my hollow hands
				By reason of my crying into them —
				And pitied me; for as cold water ran
				And washed the pitchers full from lip to lip,
				So washed both eyes full the strong salt of tears.
				And ye put water to my mouth, made sweet
				With brown hill-berries; so in time I spoke
				And gathered my loose knees from under me.
				Moreover in the broad fair halls this month
				
				Have I found space and bountiful abode
				To please me. I Demeter speak of this,
				Who am the mother and the mate of things:
				For as ill men by drugs or singing words
				Shut the doors inward of the narrowed womb
				Like a lock bolted with round iron through,
				Thus I shut up the body and sweet mouth
				Of all soft pasture and the tender land,
				So that no seed can enter in by it
				Though one sow thickly, nor some grain get out
				Past the hard clods men cleave and bite with steel
				To widen the sealed lips of them for use.
				None of you is there in the peopled street
				But knows how all the dry-drawn furrows ache
				With no green spot made count of in the black:
				How the wind finds no comfortable grass
				Nor is assuaged with bud nor breath of herbs;
				And in hot autumn when ye house the stacks,
				All fields are helpless in the sun, all trees
				Stand as a man stripped out of all but skin.
				Nevertheless ye sick have help to get
				By means and stablished ordinance of God;
				For God is wiser than a good man is.
				But never shall new grass be sweet in earth
				Till I get righted of my wound and wrong
				By changing counsel of ill-minded Zeus.
				For of all other gods is none save me
				Clothed with like power to build and break the year.
				I make the lesser green begin, when spring
				Touches not earth but with one fearful foot;
				And as a careful gilder with grave art
				Soberly colours and completes the face,
				Mouth, chin and all, of some sweet work in stone,
				I carve the shapes of grass and tender corn
				
				And colour the ripe edges and long spikes
				With the red increase and the grace of gold.
				No tradesman in soft wools is cunninger
				To kill the secret of the fat white fleece
				With stains of blue and purple wrought in it.
				Three moons were made and three moons burnt away
				While I held journey hither out of Crete
				Comfortless, tended by grave Hecate
				Whom my wound stung with double iron point;
				For all my face was like a cloth wrung out
				With close and weeping wrinkles, and both lids
				Sodden with salt continuance of tears.
				For Hades and the sidelong will of Zeus
				And that lame wisdom that has writhen feet,
				Cunning, begotten in the bed of Shame,
				These three took evil will at me, and made
				Such counsel that when time got wing to fly
				This Hades out of summer and low fields
				Forced the bright body of Persephone:
				Out of pure grass, where she lying down, red flowers
				Made their sharp little shadows on her sides,
				Pale heat, pale colour on pale maiden flesh —
				And chill water slid over her reddening feet,
				Killing the throbs in their soft blood; and birds,
				Perched next her elbow and pecking at her hair,
				Stretched their necks more to see her than even to sing.
				A sharp thing is it I have need to say;
				For Hades holding both white wrists of hers
				Unloosed the girdle and with knot by knot
				Bound her between his wheels upon the seat,
				Bound her pure body, holiest yet and dear
				To me and God as always, clothed about
				
				With blossoms loosened as her knees went down,
				Let fall as she let go of this and this
				By tens and twenties, tumbled to her feet,
				White waifs or purple of the pasturage.
				Therefore with only going up and down
				My feet were wasted, and the gracious air,
				To me discomfortable and dun, became
				As weak smoke blowing in the under world.
				And finding in the process of ill days
				What part had Zeus herein, and how as mate
				He coped with Hades, yokefellow in sin,
				I set my lips against the meat of gods
				And drank not neither ate or slept in heaven.
				Nor in the golden greeting of their mouths
				Did ear take note of me, nor eye at all
				Track my feet going in the ways of them.
				Like a great fire on some strait slip of land
				Between two washing inlets of wet sea
				That burns the grass up to each lip of beach
				And strengthens, waxing in the growth of wind,
				So burnt my soul in me at heaven and earth,
				Each way a ruin and a hungry plague,
				Visible evil; nor could any night
				Put cool between mine eyelids, nor the sun
				With competence of gold fill out my want.
				Yea so my flame burnt up the grass and stones,
				Shone to the salt-white edges of thin sea,
				Distempered all the gracious work, and made
				Sick change, unseasonable increase of days
				And scant avail of seasons; for by this
				The fair gods faint in hollow heaven: there comes
				No taste of burnings of the twofold fat
				To leave their palates smooth, nor in their lips
				Soft rings of smoke and weak scent wandering;
				
				All cattle waste and rot, and their ill smell
				Grows alway from the lank unsavoury flesh
				That no man slays for offering; the sea
				And waters moved beneath the heath and corn
				Preserve the people of fin-twinkling fish,
				And river-flies feed thick upon the smooth;
				But all earth over is no man or bird
				(Except the sweet race of the kingfisher)
				That lacks not and is wearied with much loss.
				Meantime the purple inward of the house
				Was softened with all grace of scent and sound
				In ear and nostril perfecting my praise;
				Faint grape-flowers and cloven honey-cake
				And the just grain with dues of the shed salt
				Made me content: yet my hand loosened not
				Its gripe upon your harvest all year long.
				While I, thus woman-muffled in wan flesh
				And waste externals of a perished face,
				Preserved the levels of my wrath and love
				Patiently ruled; and with soft offices
				Cooled the sharp noons and busied the warm nights
				In care of this my choice, this child my choice,
				Triptolemus, the king’s selected son:
				That this fair yearlong body, which hath grown
				Strong with strange milk upon the mortal lip
				And nerved with half a god, might so increase
				Outside the bulk and the bare scope of man:
				And waxen over large to hold within
				Base breath of yours and this impoverished air,
				I might exalt him past the flame of stars,
				The limit and walled reach of the great world.
				Therefore my breast made common to his mouth
				Immortal savours, and the taste whereat
				Twice their hard life strains out the coloured veins
				
				And twice its brain confirms the narrow shell.
				Also at night, unwinding cloth from cloth
				As who unhusks an almond to the white
				And pastures curiously the purer taste,
				I bared the gracious limbs and the soft feet,
				Unswaddled the weak hands, and in mid ash
				Laid the sweet flesh of either feeble side,
				More tender for impressure of some touch
				Than wax to any pen; and lit around
				Fire, and made crawl the white worm-shapen flame,
				And leap in little angers spark by spark
				At head at once and feet; and the faint hair
				Hissed with rare sprinkles in the closer curl,
				And like scaled oarage of a keen thin fish
				In sea-water, so in pure fire his feet
				Struck out, and the flame bit not in his flesh,
				But like a kiss it curled his lip, and heat
				Fluttered his eyelids; so each night I blew
				The hot ash red to purge him to full god.
				Ill is it when fear hungers in the soul
				For painful food, and chokes thereon, being fed;
				And ill slant eyes interpret the straight sun,
				But in their scope its white is wried to black:
				By the queen Metaneira mean I this;
				For with sick wrath upon her lips, and heart
				Narrowing with fear the spleenful passages,
				She thought to thread this web’s fine ravel out,
				Nor leave her shuttle split in combing it;
				Therefore she stole on us, and with hard sight
				Peered, and stooped close; then with pale open mouth
				As the fire smote her in the eyes between
				Cried, and the child’s laugh, sharply shortening
				As fire doth under rain, fell off; the flame
				
				Writhed once all through and died, and in thick dark
				Tears fell from mine on the child’s weeping eyes,
				Eyes dispossessed of strong inheritance
				And mortal fallen anew. Who not the less
				From bud of beard to pale-grey flower of hair
				Shall wax vinewise to a lordly vine, whose grapes
				Bleed the red heavy blood of swoln soft wine,
				Subtle with sharp leaves’ intricacy, until
				Full of white years and blossom of hoary days
				I take him perfected; for whose one sake
				I am thus gracious to the least who stands
				Filleted with white wool and girt upon
				As he whose prayer endures upon the lip
				And falls not waste: wherefore let sacrifice
				Burn and run red in all the wider ways;
				Seeing I have sworn by the pale temples’ band
				And poppied hair of gold Persephone
				Sad-tressed and pleached low down about her brows,
				And by the sorrow in her lips, and death
				Her dumb and mournful-mouthèd minister,
				My word for you is eased of its harsh weight
				And doubled with soft promise; and your king
				Triptolemus, this Celeus dead and swathed
				Purple and pale for golden burial,
				Shall be your helper in my services,
				Dividing earth and reaping fruits thereof
				In fields where wait, well-girt, well-wreathen, all
				The heavy-handed seasons all year through;
				Saving the choice of warm spear-headed grain,
				And stooping sharp to the slant-sided share
				All beasts that furrow the remeasured land
				With their bowed necks of burden equable.
