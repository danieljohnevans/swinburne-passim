            June 27, 1901
            
                Be glad in heaven above all souls insphered,
                Most royal and most loyal born of men,
                Shakespeare, of all on earth beloved or feared
                Or worshipped, highest in sight of human ken.
                The homestead hallowed by thy sovereign birth,
                Whose name, being one with thine, stands higher than Rome,
                Forgets not how of all on English earth
                Their trust is holiest, there who have their home.
                Stratford is thine and England's. None that hate
                The commonweal whose empire sets men free
                Find comfort there, where once by grace of fate
                A soul was born as boundless as the sea.
                If life, if love, if memory now be thine,
                Rejoice that still thy Stratford bears thy sign.
