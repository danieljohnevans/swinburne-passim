                A light of blameless laughter, fancy-bred,
                Soft-souled and glad and kind as love or sleep,
                Fades, and sweet mirth's own eyes are fain to weep
                Because her blithe and gentlest bird is dead.
                Weep, elves and fairies all, that never shed
                Tear yet for mortal mourning: you that keep
                The doors of dreams whence nought of ill may creep,
                Mourn once for one whose lips your honey fed.
                Let waters of the Golden River steep
                The rose-roots whence his grave blooms rosy-red,
                And murmuring of Hybl√¶an hives be deep
                About the summer silence of its bed,
                And nought less gracious than a violet peep
                Between the grass grown greener round his head.
