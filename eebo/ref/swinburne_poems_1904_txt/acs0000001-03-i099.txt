                Upon the flowery forefront of the year,
                One wandering by the grey-green April sea
                Found on a reach of shingle and shallower sand
                Inlaid with starrier glimmering jewellery
                Left for the sun's love and the light wind's cheer
                Along the foam-flowered strand
                Breeze-brightened, something nearer sea than land
                Though the last shoreward blossom-fringe was near,
                A babe asleep with flower-soft face that gleamed
                To sun and seaward as it laughed and dreamed,
                Too sure of either love for either's fear,
                Albeit so birdlike slight and light, it seemed
                Nor man nor mortal child of man, but fair
                As even its twin-born tenderer spray-flowers were,
                That the wind scatters like an Oread's hair.
            
            
                For when July strewed fire on earth and sea
                The last time ere that year,
                Out of the flame of morn Cymothoe
                Beheld one brighter than the sunbright sphere
                Move toward her from its fieriest heart, whence trod
                The live sun's very God,
                Across the foam-bright water-ways that are
                As heavenlier heavens with star for answering star,
                And on her eyes and hair and maiden mouth
                Felt a kiss falling fierier than the South
                
                And heard above afar
                A noise of songs and wind-enamoured wings
                And lutes and lyres of milder and mightier strings,
                And round the resonant radiance of his car
                Where depth is one with height,
                Light heard as music, music seen as light.
                And with that second moondawn of the spring's
                That fosters the first rose,
                A sun-child whiter than the sunlit snows
                Was born out of the world of sunless things
                That round the round earth flows and ebbs and flows.
            
            
                But he that found the sea-flower by the sea
                And took to foster like a graft of earth
                Was born of man's most highest and heavenliest birth,
                Free-born as winds and stars and waves are free;
                A warrior grey with glories more than years,
                Though more of years than change the quick to dead
                Had rained their light and darkness on his head;
                A singer that in time's and memory's ears
                Should leave such words to sing as all his peers
                Might praise with hallowing heat of rapturous tears
                Till all the days of human flight were fled.
                And at his knees his fosterling was fed
                Not with man's wine and bread
                Nor mortal mother-milk of hopes and fears,
                But food of deep memorial days long sped;
                For bread with wisdom and with song for wine
                Clear as the full calm's emerald hyaline.
                And from his grave glad lips the boy would gather
                Fine honey of song-notes goldener than gold,
                More sweet than bees make of the breathing heather,
                That he, as glad and bold,
                Might drink as they, and keep his spirit from cold.
                And the boy loved his laurel-laden hair
                
                As his own father's risen on the eastern air,
                And that less white brow-binding bayleaf bloom
                More than all flowers his father's eyes relume;
                And those high songs he heard,
                More than all notes of any landward bird,
                More than all sounds less free
                Than the wind's quiring to the choral sea.
            
            
                High things the high song taught him; how the breath
                Too frail for life may be more strong than death;
                And this poor flash of sense in life, that gleams
                As a ghost's glory in dreams,
                More stabile than the world's own heart's root seems,
                By that strong faith of lordliest love which gives
                To death's own sightless-seeming eyes a light
                Clearer, to death's bare bones a verier might,
                Than shines or strikes from any man that lives.
                How he that loves life overmuch shall die
                The dog's death, utterly:
                And he that much less loves it than he hates
                All wrongdoing that is done
                Anywhere always underneath the sun
                Shall live a mightier life than time's or fate's.
                One fairer thing he shewed him, and in might
                More strong than day and night
                Whose strengths build up time's towering period:
                Yea, one thing stronger and more high than God,
                Which if man had not, then should God not be:
                And that was Liberty.
                And gladly should man die to gain, he said,
                Freedom; and gladlier, having lost, lie dead.
                For man's earth was not, nor the sweet sea-waves
                His, nor his own land, nor its very graves,
                Except they bred not, bore not, hid not slaves:
                
                But all of all that is,
                Were one man free in body and soul, were his.
            
            
                And the song softened, even as heaven by night
                Softens, from sunnier down to starrier light,
                And with its moonbright breath
                Blessed life for death's sake, and for life's sake death.
                Till as the moon's own beam and breath confuse
                In one clear hueless haze of glimmering hues
                The sea's line and the land's line and the sky's,
                And light for love of darkness almost dies,
                As darkness only lives for light's dear love,
                Whose hands the web of night is woven of,
                So in that heaven of wondrous words were life
                And death brought out of strife;
                Yea, by that strong spell of serene increase
                brought out of strife to peace.
            
            
                And the song lightened, as the wind at morn
                Flashes, and even with lightning of the wind
                Night's thick-spun web is thinned
                And all its weft unwoven and overworn
                Shrinks, as might love from scorn.
                And as when wind and light on water and land
                Leap as twin gods from heavenward hand in hand,
                And with the sound and splendour of their leap
                Strike darkness dead, and daunt the spirit of sleep,
                And burn it up with fire;
                So with the light that lightened from the lyre
                Was all the bright heat in the child's heart stirred
                And blown with blasts of music into flame
                Till even his sense became
                Fire, as the sense that fires the devouring bird
                Whose song calls night by name.
                
                And in the soul within the sense began
                The manlike passion of a godlike man,
                And in the sense within the soul again
                Thoughts that make men of gods and gods of men.
            
            
                For love the high song taught him: love that turns
                God's heart toward man as man's to Godward; love
                That life and death and life are fashioned of,
                From the first breath that burns
                Half kindled on the flowerlike yeanling's lip,
                So light and faint that life seems like to slip,
                To that yet weaklier drawn
                When sunset dies of night's devouring dawn.
                But the man dying not wholly as all men dies
                If aught be left of his in live men's eyes
                Out of the dawnless dark of death to rise;
                If aught of deed or word
                Be seen for all time or of all time heard.
                Love, that though body and soul were overthrown
                Should live for love's sake of itself alone,
                Though spirit and flesh were one thing doomed and dead,
                Not wholly annihilated.
                Seeing even the hoariest ash-flake that the pyre
                Drops, and forgets the thing was once afire
                And gave its heart to feed the pile's full flame
                Till its own heart its own heat overcame,
                Outlives its own life, though by scarce a span,
                As such men dying outlive themselves in man,
                outlive themselves for ever; if the heat
                Outburn the heart that kindled it, the sweet
                Outlast the flower Whose soul it was, and flit
                Forth of the body of it
                
                Into some new shape of a strange perfume
                More potent than its light live spirit of bloom,
                How shall not something of that soul relive,
                That only soul that had such gifts to give
                As lighten something even of all men's doom
                Even from the labouring womb
                Even to the seal set on the unopening tomb?
                And these the loving light of song and love
                Shall wrap and lap round and impend above,
                Imperishable; and all springs born illume
                Their sleep with brighter thoughts than wake the dove
                To music, when the hillside winds resume
                The marriage-song of heather-flower and broom
                And all the joy thereof.
            
            
                And hate the song too taught him: hate of all
                That brings or holds in thrall
                Of spirit or flesh, free-born ere God began,
                The holy body and sacred soul of man.
                And wheresoever a curse was or a chain,
                A throne for torment or a crown for bane
                Rose, moulded out of poor men's molten pain,
                There, said he, should man's heaviest hate be set
                Inexorably, to faint not or forget
                Till the last warmth bled Forth of the last vein
                In flesh that none should call a king's again,
                Seeing wolves and dogs and birds that plague-Strike air
                Leave the last bone of all the carrion bare.
            
            
                And hope the high song taught him: hope whose eyes
                Can sound the seas unsoundable, the skies
                Inaccessible of eyesight; that can see
                
                What earth beholds not, hear What wind and sea
                Hear not, and speak What all these crying in one
                Can speak not to the sun.
                For in her sovereign eyelight all things are
                Clear as the closest seen and kindlier star
                That marries morn and even and winter and spring
                With one love's golden ring.
                For she can see the days of man, the birth
                Of good and death of evil things on earth
                Inevitable and infinite, and sure
                As present pain is, or herself is pure.
                Yea, she Can hear and see, beyond all things
                That lighten from before Time's thunderous wings
                Through the awful circle of wheel-winged periods,
                The tempest of the twilight of all Gods:
                And higher than all the circling course they ran
                The sundawn of the spirit that was man.
            
            
                And fear the song too taught him; fear to be
                Worthless the dear love of the wind and sea
                That bred him fearless, like a sea-mew reared
                In rocks of man's foot feared,
                Where nought of wingless life may sing or shine.
                Fear to wax worthless of that heaven he had
                When all the life in all his limbs was glad
                And all the drops in all his veins were wine
                And all the pulses music; when his heart,
                Singing, bade heaven and wind and sea bear part
                In one live song's reiterance, and they bore:
                Fear to go crownless of the flower he wore
                When the winds loved him and the waters knew,
                The blithest life that clove their blithe life through
                With living limbs exultant, or held strife
                More amorous than all dalliance aye anew
                With the bright breath and strength of their large life,
                
                With all strong wrath of all sheer winds that blew,
                All glories of all storms of the air that fell
                Prone, ineluctable,
                With roar from heaven of revel, and with hue
                As of a heaven turned hell.
                For when the red blast of their breath had made
                All heaven aflush with light more dire than shade,
                He felt it in his blood and eyes and hair
                burn as if all the fires of the earth and air
                Had laid strong hold upon his flesh, and stung
                The soul behind it as with serpent's tongue,
                Forked like the loveliest lightnings: nor could bear
                But hardly, half distraught with strong delight,
                The joy that like a garment wrapped him round
                And lapped him over and under
                With raiment of great light
                And rapture of great sound
                At every loud leap earthward of the thunder
                From heaven's most furthest bound:
                So seemed all heaven in hearing and in sight,
                Alive and mad with glory and angry joy,
                That something of its marvellous mirth and might
                Moved even to madness, fledged as even for flight,
                The blood and spirit of one but mortal boy.
            
            
                So, clothed with love and fear that love makes great,
                And armed with hope and hate,
                He set first foot upon the spring-flowered ways
                That all feet pass and praise.
                And one dim dawn between the winter and spring,
                In the sharp harsh wind harrying heaven and earth
                To put back April that had borne his birth
                From sunward on her sunniest shower-struck wing,
                With tears and laughter for the dew-dropt thing,
                
                Slight as indeed a dew-drop, by the sea
                One met him lovelier than all men may be,
                God-featured, with god's eyes; and in their might
                Somewhat that drew men's own to mar their sight,
                Even of all eyes drawn toward him: and his mouth
                Was as the very rose of all men's youth,
                One rose of all the rose-beds in the world:
                But round his brows the curls were snakes that curled,
                And like his tongue a serpent's; and his voice
                Speaks death, and bids rejoice.
                yet then he spake no word, seeming as dumb,
                A dumb thing mild and hurtless; nor at first
                From his bowed eyes seemed any light to come,
                Nor his meek lips for blood or tears to thirst:
                But as one blind and mute in mild sweet wise
                Pleading for pity of piteous lips and eyes,
                He strayed with faint bare lily-lovely feet
                Helpless, and flowerlike sweet:
                Nor might man see, not having word hereof,
                That this of all gods was the great god Love.
            
            
                And seeing him lovely and like a little child
                That wellnigh wept for wonder that it smiled
                And was so feeble and fearful, with soft speech
                The youth bespake him softly; but There fell
                From the sweet lips no sweet word audible
                That ear or thought might reach:
                No sound to make the dim cold silence glad,
                No breath to thaw the hard harsh air with heat;
                Only the saddest smile of all things sweet,
                Only the sweetest smile of all things sad.
            
            
                And so they went together one green way
                Till April dying made free the world for May;
                
                And on his guide suddenly Love's face turned,
                And in his blind eyes burned
                Hard light and heat of laughter; and like flame
                That opens in a mountain's ravening mouth
                To blear and sear the sunlight from the south,
                His mute mouth opened, and his first word came:
                ‘Knowest thou me now by name?’
                And all his stature waxed immeasurable,
                As of one shadowing heaven and lightening hell;
                And statelier stood he than a tower that stands
                And darkens with its darkness far-off sands
                Whereon the sky leans red;
                And with a voice that stilled the winds he said:
                ‘I am he that was thy lord before thy birth,
                I am he that is thy lord till thou turn earth:
                I make the night more dark, and all the morrow
                Dark as the night Whose darkness was my breath:
                O fool, my name is sorrow;
                Thou fool, my name is death.’
            
            
                And he that heard spake not, and looked right on
                Again, and Love was gone.
            
            
                Through many a night toward many a wearier day
                His spirit bore his body down its way.
                Through many a day toward many a wearier night
                His soul sustained his sorrows in her sight.
                And earth was bitter, and heaven, and even the sea
                Sorrowful even as he.
                And the wind helped not, and the sun was dumb;
                And with too long strong stress of grief to be
                His heart grew sere and numb.
            
            
                And one bright eve ere summer in autumn sank
                At stardawn standing on a grey sea-bank
                
                He felt the wind fitfully shift and heave
                As toward a stormier eve;
                And all the wan wide sea shuddered; and earth
                Shook underfoot as toward some timeless birth,
                Intolerable and Inevitable; and all
                Heaven, darkling, trembled like a stricken thrall.
                And far out of the quivering east, and far
                From past the moonrise and its guiding star,
                Began a noise of tempest and a light
                That was not of the lightning; and a sound
                Rang with it round and round
                That was not of the thunder; and a flight
                As of blown clouds by night,
                That was not of them; and with songs and cries
                That sang and shrieked their soul out at the skies
                A shapeless earthly storm of shapes began
                From all ways round to move in on the man,
                Clamorous against him silent; and their feet
                Were as the wind's are fleet,
                And their shrill songs were as wild birds' are sweet.
            
            
                And as when all the world of earth was wronged
                And all the host of all men driven afoam
                By the red hand of Rome,
                Round some fierce amphitheatre overthronged
                With fair clear faces full of bloodier lust
                Than swells and stings the tiger when his mood
                Is fieriest after blood
                And drunk with trampling of the murderous must
                That soaks and stains the tortuous close-coiled wood
                Made monstrous with its myriad-mustering brood,
                Face by fair face panted and gleamed and pressed,
                And breast by passionate breast
                
                Heaved hot with ravenous rapture, as they quaffed
                The red ripe full fume of the deep live draught,
                The sharp quick reek of keen fresh bloodshed, blown
                Through the dense deep drift up to the emperor's throne
                From the under steaming sands
                With clamour of all-applausive throats and hands,
                Mingling in mirthful time
                With shrill blithe mockeries of the lithe-limbed mime:
                So from somewhence far forth of the unbeholden,
                Dreadfully driven from over and after and under,
                Fierce, blown through fifes of brazen blast and golden,
                With sound of chiming waves that drown the thunder
                Or thunder that strikes dumb the sea's own chimes,
                Began the bellowing of the bull-voiced mimes,
                Terrible; firs bowed down as briars or palms
                Even at the breathless blast as of a breeze
                Fulfilled with clamour and clangour and storms of psalms;
                Red hands rent up the roots of old-world trees,
                thick flames of torches tossed as tumbling seas
                made mad the moonless and infuriate air
                That, ravening, revelled in the riotous hair
                And raiment of the furred Bassarides.
            
            
                So came all those in on him; and his heart,
                As out of sleep suddenly struck astart,
                Danced, and his flesh took fire of theirs, and grief
                Was as a last year's leaf
                Blown dead far down the wind's way; and he set
                His pale mouth to the brightest mouth it met
                That laughed for love against his lips, and bade
                Follow; and in following all his blood grew glad
                
                And as again a sea-bird's; for the wind
                Took him to bathe him deep round breast and brow
                Not as it takes a dead leaf drained and thinned,
                But as the brightest bay-flower blown on bough,
                Set springing toward it singing: and they rode
                By many a vine-leafed, many a rose-hung road,
                Exalt with exultation; many a night
                Set all its stars upon them as for spies
                On many a moon-bewildering mountain-height
                Where he rode only by the fierier light
                Of his dread lady's hot sweet hungering eyes.
                For the moon wandered witless of her way,
                spell-stricken by strong magic in such wise
                As wizards use to set the stars astray.
                And in his ears the music that makes mad
                Beat always; and What way the music bade,
                That alway rode he; nor was any sleep
                His, nor from height nor deep.
                But heaven was as red iron, slumberless,
                And had no heart to bless;
                And earth lay sere and darkling as distraught,
                And help in her was nought.
            
            
                Then many a midnight, many a morn and even,
                His mother, passing forth of her fair heaven,
                With goodlier gifts than all save gods can give
                From earth or from the heaven where sea-things live,
                With shine of sea-flowers through the bay-leaf braid
                Woven for a crown her foam-white hands had made
                To crown him with land's laurel and sea-dew,
                Sought the sea-bird that was her boy: but he
                Sat panther-throned beside Erigone,
                Riding the red ways of the revel through
                Midmost of pale-mouthed passion's crownless crew.
                
                Till on some winter's dawn of some dim year
                He let the vine-bit on the panther's lip
                Slide, and the green rein slip,
                And set his eyes to seaward, nor gave ear
                If sound from landward hailed him, dire or dear;
                And passing forth of all those fair fierce ranks
                Back to the grey sea-banks,
                Against a sea-rock lying, aslant the steep,
                Fell after many sleepless dreams on sleep.
            
            
                And in his sleep the dun green light was shed
                Heavily round his head
                That through the veil of sea falls fathom-deep,
                Blurred like a lamp's that when the night drops dead
                Dies; and his eyes gat grace of sleep to see
                The deep divine dark dayshine of the sea,
                Dense water-walls and clear dusk water-ways,
                Broad-based, or branching as a sea-flower sprays
                That side or this dividing; and anew
                The glory of all her glories that he knew.
                And in sharp rapture of recovering tears
                He woke on fire with yearnings of old years,
                Pure as one purged of pain that passion bore,
                Ill child of bitter mother; for his own
                looked laughing toward him from her midsea throne,
                up toward him There ashore.
            
            
                Thence in his heart the great same joy began,
                Of child that made him man:
                And turned again from all hearts else on quest,
                He communed with his own heart, and had rest.
                And like sea-winds upon loud waters ran
                His days and dreams together, till the joy
                Burned in him of the boy.
                
                Till the earth's great comfort and the sweet sea's breath
                Breathed and blew life in where was heartless death,
                Death spirit-stricken of soul-sick days, where strife
                Of thought and flesh made mock of death and life.
                And grace returned upon him of his birth
                Where heaven was mixed with heavenlike sea and earth;
                And song shot forth strong wings that took the sun
                From inward, fledged with might of sorrow and mirth
                And father's fire made mortal in his son.
                Nor was not spirit of strength in blast and breeze
                To exalt again the sun's child and the sea's;
                For as wild mares in Thessaly grow great
                With child of ravishing winds, that violate
                Their leaping length of limb with manes like fire
                And eyes outburning heaven's
                With fires more violent than the lightning levin's
                And breath drained out and desperate of desire,
                Even so the spirit in him, when winds grew strong,
                Grew great with child of song.
                Nor less than when his veins first leapt for joy
                To draw delight in such as burns a boy,
                Now too the soul of all his senses felt
                The passionate pride of deep sea-pulses dealt
                Through nerve and jubilant vein
                As from the love and largess of old time,
                And with his heart again
                The tidal throb of all the tides keep rhyme
                And charm him from his own soul's separate sense
                With infinite and invasive influence
                That made strength sweet in him and sweetness strong,
                Being now no more a singer, but a song.
            
            
            
                Till one clear day when brighter sea-wind blew
                And louder sea-shine lightened, for the waves
                Were full of godhead and the light that saves,
                His father's, and their spirit had pierced him through,
                He felt strange breath and light all round him shed
                That bowed him down with rapture; and he knew
                His father's hand, hallowing his humbled head,
                And the old great voice of the old good time, that said:
            
            
                “Child of my sunlight and the sea, from birth
                A fosterling and fugitive on earth;
                Sleepless of soul as wind or wave or fire,
                A manchild with an ungrown God's desire;
                Because thou hast loved nought mortal more than me,
                Thy father, and thy mother-hearted sea;
                Because thou hast set thine heart to sing, and sold
                Life and life's love for song, God's living gold;
                Because thou hast given thy flower and fire of youth
                To feed men's hearts with visions, truer than truth;
                Because thou hast kept in those world-wandering eyes
                The light that makes me music of the skies;
                Because thou hast heard with world-unwearied ears
                The music that puts light into the spheres;
                Have therefore in thine heart and in thy mouth
                The sound of song that mingles north and south,
                The song of all the winds that sing of me,
                And in thy soul the sense of all the sea.”
