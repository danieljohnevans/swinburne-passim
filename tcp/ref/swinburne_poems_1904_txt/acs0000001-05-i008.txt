			(Gratefully inscribed to Dr. A. B. Grosart.)
			
				Sweet song-flower of the Mayspring of our song,
				Be welcome to us, with loving thanks and praise
				To his good hand who travelling on strange ways
				Found thee forlorn and fragrant, lain along
				Beneath dead leaves that many a winter's wrong
				Had rained and heaped through nigh three centuries' maze
				Above thy Maybloom, hiding from our gaze
				The life that in thy leaves lay sweet and strong.
				For thine have life, while many above thine head
				Piled by the wind lie blossomless and dead.
				So now disburdened of such load above
				That lay as death's own dust upon thee shed
				By days too deaf to hear thee like a dove
				Murmuring, we hear thee, bird and flower of love.
