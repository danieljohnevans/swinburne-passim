                				I
                				LOVE LIES BLEEDING
                				
                					Love lies bleeding in the bed whereover
                					Roses lean with smiling mouths or pleading:
                					Earth lies laughing where the sun's dart clove her:
                					Love lies bleeding.
                				
                				
                					Stately shine his purple plumes, exceeding
                					Pride of princes: nor shall maid or lover
                					Find on earth a fairer sign worth heeding.
                				
                				
                					Yet may love, sore wounded, scarce recover
                					Strength and spirit again, with life receding:
                					Hope and joy, wind-winged, about him hover:
                					Love lies bleeding.
                				
                			
                			
                				II 
                				LOVE IN A MIST
                				
                					Light love in a mist, by the midsummer moon misguided,
                					Scarce seen in the twilight garden if gloom insist,
                					Seems vainly to seek for a star whose gleam has derided
                					Light love in a mist.
                				
                				
                				
                					All day in the sun, when the breezes do all they list,
                					His soft blue raiment of cloudlike blossom abided
                					Unrent and unwithered of winds and of rays that kissed.
                				
                				
                					Blithe-hearted or sad, as the cloud or the sun subsided,
                					Love smiled in the flower with a meaning whereof none wist
                					Save two that beheld, as a gleam that before them glided,
                					Light love in a mist.
