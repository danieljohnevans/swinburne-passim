                Yet again another, ere his crowning year,
                Gone from friends that here may look for him no more.
                Never now for him shall hope set wide the door,
                Hope that hailed him hither, fain to greet him here.
                All the gracious garden-flowers he held so dear,
                Oldworld English blossoms, all his homestead store,
                Oldworld grief had strewn them round his bier of yore,
                Bidding each drop leaf by leaf as tear by tear;
                Rarer lutes than mine had borne more tuneful token,
                Touched by subtler hands than echoing time can wrong,
                Sweet as flowers had strewn his graveward path along.
                Now may no such old sweet dirges more be spoken,
                Now the flowers whose breath was very song are broken,
                Nor may sorrow find again so sweet a song.
