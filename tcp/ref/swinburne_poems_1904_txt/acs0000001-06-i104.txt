            Patience, long sick to death, is dead. Too long
            Have sloth and doubt and treason bidden us be
            What Cromwell's England was not, when the sea
            To him bore witness given of Blake how strong
            She stood, a commonweal that brooked no wrong
            From foes less vile than men like wolves set free
            Whose war is waged where none may fight or fleeâ€”
            With women and with weanlings. Speech and song
            Lack utterance now for loathing. Scarce we hear
            Foul tongues that blacken God's dishonoured name
            With prayers turned curses and with praise found shame
            Defy the truth whose witness now draws near
            To scourge these dogs, agape with jaws afoam,
            Down out of life. Strike, England, and strike home.
            
            October 9, 1899.
