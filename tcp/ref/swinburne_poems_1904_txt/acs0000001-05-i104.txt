    					What will it please you, my darling, hereafter to be?
    					
    					Fame upon land will you look for, or glory by sea?
    					Gallant your life will be always, and all of it free.
    				
    				
    					Free as the wind when the heart of the twilight is stirred
    					Eastward, and sounds from the springs of the sunrise are heard:
    					Freeâ€”and we know not another as infinite word.
    				
    				
    					Darkness or twilight or sunlight may compass us round,
    					Hate may arise up against us, or hope may confound;
    					Love may forsake us; yet may not the spirit be bound.
    				
    				
    					Free in oppression of grief as in ardour of joy
    					Still may the soul be, and each to her strength as a toy:
    					Free in the glance of the man as the smile of the boy.
    				
    				
    					Freedom alone is the salt and the spirit that gives
    					Life, and without her is nothing that verily lives:
    					Death cannot slay her: she laughs upon death and forgives.
    				
    				
    				
    					Brightest and hardiest of roses anear and afar
    					Glitters the blithe little face of you, round as a star:
    					Liberty bless you and keep you to be as you are.
    				
    				
    					England and liberty bless you and keep you to be
    					Worthy the name of their child and the sight of their sea:
    					Fear not at all; for a slave, if he fears not, is free.
