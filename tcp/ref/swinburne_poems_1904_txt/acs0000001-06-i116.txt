                I
                
                    Soft, small, and sweet as sunniest flowers
                    That bask in heavenly heat
                    When bud by bud breaks, breathes, and cowers,
                    Soft, small, and sweet.
                
                
                    A babe's hands open as to greet
                    The tender touch of ours
                    And mock with motion faint and fleet
                
                
                    The minutes of the new strange hours
                    That earth, not heaven, must mete;
                    Buds fragrant still from heaven's own bowers,
                    Soft, small, and sweet.
                
            
            
                II
                
                    A velvet vice with springs of steel
                    That fasten in a trice
                    And clench the fingers fast that feel
                    A velvet vice—
                
                
                    What man would risk the danger twice,
                    Nor quake from head to heel?
                    Whom would not one such test suffice?
                
                
                
                    Well may we tremble as we kneel
                    In sight of Paradise,
                    If both a babe's closed fists conceal
                    A velvet vice.
                
            
            
                III
                
                    Two flower-soft fists of conquering clutch,
                    Two creased and dimpled wrists,
                    That match, if mottled overmuch,
                    Two flower-soft fists—
                
                
                    What heart of man dare hold the lists
                    Against such odds and such
                    Sweet vantage as no strength resists?
                
                
                    Our strength is all a broken crutch,
                    Our eyes are dim with mists,
                    Our hearts are prisoners as we touch
                    Two flower-soft fists.
