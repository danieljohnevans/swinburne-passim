                Sound of trumpets blowing down the merriest winds of morn,
                Flash of hurtless lightnings, laugh of thunders loud and glad,
                Here should hail the summer day whereon a light was born
                Whence the sun grew brighter, seeing the world less dark and sad.
                Man of men by right divine of boyhood everlasting,
                France incarnate, France immortal in her deathless boy,
                Brighter birthday never shone than thine on earth, forecasting
                More of strenuous mirth in manhood, more of manful joy.
                Child of warriors, friend of warriors, Garibaldi's friend,
                Even thy name is as the splendour of a sunbright sword:
                While the boy's heart beats in man, thy fame shall find not end:
                Time and dark oblivion bow before thee as their lord.
                
                Youth acclaims thee gladdest of the gods that gild his days:
                Age gives thanks for thee, and death lacks heart to quench thy praise.
