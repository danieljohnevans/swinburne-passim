				Maiden most beautiful, mother most bountiful, lady of lands,
				Queen and republican, crowned of the centuries whose years are thy sands,
				See for thy sake what we bring to thee, Italy, here in our hands.
			
			
				This is the banner thy gonfalon, fair in the front of thy fight,
				Red from the hearts that were pierced for thee, white as thy mountains are white,
				Green as the spring of thy soul everlasting, whose life-blood is light.
			
			
				Take to thy bosom thy banner, a fair bird fit for the nest,
				Feathered for flight into sunrise or sunset, for eastward or west,
				Fledged for the flight everlasting, but held yet warm to thy breast.
			
			
				Gather it close to thee, song-bird or storm-bearer, eagle or dove,
				Lift it to sunward, a beacon beneath to the beacon above,
				Green as our hope in it, white as our faith in it, red as our love.
			
			
			
				Thunder and splendour of lightning are hid in the folds of it furled;
				Who shall unroll it but thou, as thy bolt to be handled and hurled,
				Out of whose lips is the honey, whose bosom the milk of the world?
			
			
				Out of thine hands hast thou fed us with pasture of colour and song;
				Glory and beauty by birthright to thee as thy garments belong;
				Out of thine hands thou shalt give us as surely deliverance from wrong.
			
			
				Out of thine eyes thou hast shed on us love as a lamp in our night,
				Wisdom a lodestar to ships, and remembrance a flame-coloured light;
				Out of thine eyes thou shalt shew us as surely the sundawn of right.
			
			
				Turn to us, speak to us, Italy, mother, but once and a word,
				None shall not follow thee, none shall not serve thee, not one that has heard;
				Twice hast thou spoken a message, and time is athirst for the third.
			
			
				Kingdom and empire of peoples thou hadst, and thy lordship made one
				North sea and south sea and east men and west men that look on the sun;
				Spirit was in thee and counsel, when soul in the nations was none.
			
			
			
				Banner and beacon thou wast to the centuries of storm-wind and foam,
				Ages that clashed in the dark with each other, and years without home;
				Empress and prophetess wast thou, and what wilt thou now be, O Rome?
			
			
				Ah, by the faith and the hope and the love that have need of thee now,
				Shines not thy face with the forethought of freedom, and burns not thy brow?
				Who is against her but all men? and who is beside her but thou?
			
			
				Art thou not better than all men? and where shall she turn but to thee?
				Lo, not a breath, not a beam, not a beacon from midland to sea;
				Freedom cries out for a sign among nations, and none will be free.
			
			
				England in doubt of her, France in despair of her, all without heart—
				Stand on her side in the vanward of ages, and strike on her part!
				Strike but one stroke for the love of her love of thee, sweet that thou art!
			
			
				Take in thy right hand thy banner, a strong staff fit for thine hand;
				Forth at the light of it lifted shall foul things flock from the land;
				Faster than stars from the sun shall they fly, being lighter than sand.
			
			
			
				Green thing to green in the summer makes answer, and rose-tree to rose;
				Lily by lily the year becomes perfect; and none of us knows
				What thing is fairest of all things on earth as it brightens and blows.
			
			
				This thing is fairest in all time of all things, in all time is best —
				Freedom, that made thee, our mother, and suckled her sons at thy breast;
				Take to thy bosom the nations, and there shall the world come to rest.
