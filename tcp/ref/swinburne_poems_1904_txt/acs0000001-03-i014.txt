            (To Barry Cornwall)
            
                I
                In vain men tell us time can alter
                Old loves or make old memories falter,
                That with the old year the old year's life closes.
                The old dew still falls on the old sweet flowers,
                The old sun revives the new-fledged hours,
                The old summer rears the new-born roses.
            
            
                II
                Much more a Muse that bears upon her
                Raiment and wreath and flower of honour,
                Gathered long since and long since woven,
                Fades not or falls as fall the vernal
                Blossoms that bear no fruit eternal,
                By summer or winter charred or cloven.
            
            
                III
                No time casts down, no time upraises,
                Such loves, such memories, and such praises,
                As need no grace of sun or shower,
                No saving screen from frost or thunder
                To tend and house around and under
                The imperishable and fearless flower.
            
            
            
                IV
                Old thanks, old thoughts, old aspirations,
                Outlive men's lives and lives of nations,
                Dead, but for one thing which survivesâ€”
                The inalienable and unpriced treasure,
                The old joy of power, the old pride of pleasure,
                That lives in light above men's lives.
