                				Deep desire, that pierces heart and spirit to the root,
                				Finds reluctant voice in verse that yearns like soaring fire,
                				Takes exultant voice when music holds in high pursuit
                				Deep desire.
                			
                			
                				Keen as burns the passion of the rose whose buds respire,
                				Strong as grows the yearning of the blossom toward the fruit,
                				Sounds the secret half unspoken ere the deep tones tire.
                			
                			
                				Slow subsides the rapture that possessed love's flower-soft lute,
                				Slow the palpitation of the triumph of the lyre:
                				Still the soul feels burn, a flame unslaked though these be mute,
                				Deep desire.
