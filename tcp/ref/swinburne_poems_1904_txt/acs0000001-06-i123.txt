                Swift music made of passion's changeful power,
                Sweet as the change that leaves the world in flower
                When spring laughs winter down to deathward, rang
                From grave and gracious lips that smiled and sang
                When Massinger, too wise for kings to hear
                And learn of him truth, wisdom, faith, or fear,
                Gave all his gentler heart to love's light lore,
                That grief might brood and scorn breed wrath no more.
                Soft, bright, fierce, tender, fitful, truthful, sweet,
                A shrine where faith and change might smile and meet,
                A soul whose music could but shift its tune
                As when the lustrous year turns May to June
                And spring subsides in summer, so makes good
                Its perfect claim to very womanhood.
                The heart that hate of wrong made fire, the hand
                Whose touch was fire as keen as shame's own brand
                When fraud and treason, swift to smile and sting,
                Crowned and discrowned a tyrant, knave or king,
                False each and ravenous as the fitful sea,
                Grew gently glad as love that fear sets free.
                Like eddying ripples that the wind restrains,
                The bright words whisper music ere it wanes.
                
                Ere fades the sovereign sound of song that rang
                As though the sun to match the sea's tune sang,
                When noon from dawn took life and light, and time
                Shone, seeing how Shakespeare made the world sublime,
                Ere sinks the wind whose breath was heaven's and day's,
                The sunset's witness gives the sundawn praise.
