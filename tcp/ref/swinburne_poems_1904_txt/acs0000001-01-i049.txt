				There were four apples on the bough,
				Half gold half red, that one might know
				The blood was ripe inside the core;
				The colour of the leaves was more
				Like stems of yellow corn that grow
				Through all the gold June meadow’s floor.
			
			
				The warm smell of the fruit was good
				To feed on, and the split green wood,
				With all its bearded lips and stains
				Of mosses in the cloven veins,
				Most pleasant, if one lay or stood
				In sunshine or in happy rains.
			
			
				There were four apples on the tree,
				Red stained through gold, that all might see
				The sun went warm from core to rind;
				The green leaves made the summer blind
				In that soft place they kept for me
				With golden apples shut behind.
			
			
				The leaves caught gold across the sun,
				And where the bluest air begun
				
				Thirsted for song to help the heat;
				As I to feel my lady’s feet
				Draw close before the day were done;
				Both lips grew dry with dreams of it.
			
			
				In the mute August afternoon
				They trembled to some undertune
				Of music in the silver air;
				Great pleasure was it to be there
				Till green turned duskier and the moon
				Coloured the corn-sheaves like gold hair.
			
			
				That August time it was delight
				To watch the red moons wane to white
				’Twixt grey seamed stems of apple-trees;
				A sense of heavy harmonies
				Grew on the growth of patient night,
				More sweet than shapen music is.
			
			
				But some three hours before the moon
				The air, still eager from the noon,
				Flagged after heat, not wholly dead;
				Against the stem I leant my head;
				The colour soothed me like a tune,
				Green leaves all round the gold and red.
			
			
				I lay there till the warm smell grew
				More sharp, when flecks of yellow dew
				Between the round ripe leaves had blurred
				The rind with stain and wet; I heard
				A wind that blew and breathed and blew,
				Too weak to alter its one word.
			
			
			
				The wet leaves next the gentle fruit
				Felt smoother, and the brown tree-root
				Felt the mould warmer: I too felt
				(As water feels the slow gold melt
				Right through it when the day burns mute)
				The peace of time wherein love dwelt.
			
			
				There were four apples on the tree,
				Gold stained on red that all might see
				The sweet blood filled them to the core:
				The colour of her hair is more
				Like stems of fair faint gold, that be
				Mown from the harvest’s middle floor.
