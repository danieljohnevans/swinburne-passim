    					Looking on a page where stood
    					Graven of old on old-world wood
    					Death, and by the grave's edge grim,
    					Pale, the young man facing him,
    					Asked my well-beloved of me
    					Once what strange thing this might be,
    					Gaunt and great of limb.
    				
    				
    					Death, I told him: and, surprise
    					Deepening more his wildwood eyes
    					(Like some sweet fleet thing's whose breath
    					Speaks all spring though nought it saith),
    					Up he turned his rosebright face
    					Glorious with its seven years' grace,
    					Askingâ€”What is death?
