                Light, as when dawn takes wing and smites the sea,
                Smote England when his day bade Marlowe be.
                No fire so keen had thrilled the clouds of time
                Since Dante's breath made Italy sublime.
                Earth, bright with flowers whose dew shone soft as tears,
                Through Chaucer cast her charm on eyes and ears:
                The lustrous laughter of the love-lit earth
                Rang, leapt, and lightened in his might of mirth.
                Deep moonlight, hallowing all the breathless air,
                Made earth and heaven for Spenser faint and fair.
                But song might bid not heaven and earth be one
                Till Marlowe's voice gave warning of the sun.
                Thought quailed and fluttered as a wounded bird
                Till passion fledged the wing of Marlowe's word.
                Faith born of fear bade hope and doubt be dumb
                Till Marlowe's pride bade light or darkness come.
                Then first our speech was thunder: then our song
                Shot lightning through the clouds that wrought us wrong.
                Blind fear, whose faith feeds hell with fire, became
                A moth self-shrivelled in its own blind flame.
                We heard, in tune with even our seas that roll,
                The speech of storm, the thunders of the soul.
                
                Men's passions, clothed with all the woes they wrought,
                Shone through the fire of man's transfiguring thought.
                The thirst of knowledge, quenchless at her springs,
                Ambition, fire that clasps the thrones of kings,
                Love, light that makes of life one lustrous hour,
                And song, the soul's chief crown and throne of power,
                The hungering heart of greed and ravenous hate,
                Made music high as heaven and deep as fate.
                Strange pity, scarce half scornful of her tear,
                In Berkeley's vaults bowed down on Edward's bier.
                But higher in forceful flight of song than all
                The soul of man, its own imperious thrall,
                Rose, when his royal spirit of fierce desire
                Made life and death for man one flame of fire.
                Incarnate man, fast bound as earth and sea,
                Spake, when his pride would fain set Faustus free.
                Eternal beauty, strong as day and night,
                Shone, when his word bade Helen back to sight.
                Fear, when he bowed the soul before her spell,
                Thundered and lightened through the vaults of hell.
                The music known of all men's tongues that sing,
                When Marlowe sang, bade love make heaven of spring;
                The music none but English tongues may make,
                Our own sole song, spake first when Marlowe spake;
                And on his grave, though there no stone may stand,
                The flower it shows was laid by Shakespeare's hand.
