                				Love's twilight wanes in heaven above,
                				On earth ere twilight reigns:
                				Ere fear may feel the chill thereof,
                				Love's twilight wanes.
                			
                			
                				Ere yet the insatiate heart complains
                				“Too much, and scarce enough,”
                				The lip so late athirst refrains.
                			
                			
                				Soft on the neck of either dove
                				Love's hands let slip the reins:
                				And while we look for light of love
                				Love's twilight wanes.
