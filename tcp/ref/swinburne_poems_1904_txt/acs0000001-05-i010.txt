			The Launch of the Livadia
			
				I
				Gold , and fair marbles, and again more gold,
				And space of halls afloat that glance and gleam
				Like the green heights of sunset heaven, or seem
				The golden steeps of sunrise red and cold
				On deserts where dark exile keeps the fold
				Fast of the flocks of torment, where no beam
				Falls of kind light or comfort save in dream,
				These we far off behold not, who behold
				The cordage woven of curses, and the decks
				With mortal hate and mortal peril paven;
				From stem to stern the lines of doom engraven
				That mark for sure inevitable wrecks
				Those sails predestinate, though no storm vex,
				To miss on earth and find in hell their haven.

				All curses be about her, and all ill
				Go with her; heaven be dark above her way,
				The gulf beneath her glad and sure of prey,
				And, wheresoe'er her prow be pointed, still
				The winds of heaven have all one evil will
				Conspirant even as hearts of kings to slay
				With mouths of kings to lie and smile and pray,
				And chiefliest his whose wintrier breath makes chill
				
				With more than winter's and more poisonous cold
				The horror of his kingdom toward the north,
				The deserts of his kingdom toward the east.
				And though death hide not in her direful hold
				Be all stars adverse toward her that come forth
				Nightly, by day all hours till all have ceased:
			
			
				III
				Till all have ceased for ever, and the sum
				Be summed of all the sumless curses told
				Out on his head by all dark seasons rolled
				Over its cursed and crowned existence, dumb
				And blind and stark as though the snows made numb
				All sense within it, and all conscience cold,
				That hangs round hearts of less imperial mould
				Like a snake feeding till their doomsday come.
				O heart fast bound of frozen poison, be
				All nature's as all true men's hearts to thee,
				A two-edged sword of judgment; hope be far
				And fear at hand for pilot oversea
				With death for compass and despair for star,
				And the white foam a shroud for the White Czar.
