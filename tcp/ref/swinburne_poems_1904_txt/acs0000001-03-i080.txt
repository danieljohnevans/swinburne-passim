                April made me: winter laid me here away asleep.
                Bright as Maytime was my daytime; night is soft and deep:
                Though the morrow bring forth sorrow, well are ye that weep.
            
            
                Ye that held me dear beheld me not a twelvemonth long:
                All the while ye saw me smile, ye knew not whence the song
                Came that made me smile, and laid me here, and wrought you wrong.
            
            
                Angels, calling from your brawling world one undefiled,
                Homeward bade me, and forbade me here to rest beguiled:
                Here I sleep not: pass, and weep not here upon your child.
