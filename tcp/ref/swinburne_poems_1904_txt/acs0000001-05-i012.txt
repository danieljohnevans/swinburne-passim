			(To a friend leaving England for a year's residence
				in Australia.)
			
				These winds and suns of spring
				That warm with breath and wing
				The trembling sleep of earth, till half awake
				She laughs and blushes ere her slumber break,
				For all good gifts they bring
				Require one better thing,
				For all the loans of joy they lend us, borrow
				One sharper dole of sorrow,
				To sunder soon by half a world of sea
				Her son from England and my friend from me.
			
			
				Nor hope nor love nor fear
				May speed or stay one year,
				Nor song nor prayer may bid, as mine would fain,
				The seasons perish and be born again,
				Restoring all we lend,
				Reluctant, of a friend,
				The voice, the hand, the presence and the sight
				That lend their life and light
				To present gladness and heart-strengthening cheer,
				Now lent again for one reluctant year.
			
			
			
				So much we lend indeed,
				Perforce, by force of need,
				So much we must; even these things and no more
				The far sea sundering and the sundered shore,
				A world apart from ours,
				So much the imperious hours,
				Exact, and spare not; but no more than these
				All earth and all her seas
				From thought and faith of trust and truth can borrow,
				Not memory from desire, nor hope from sorrow.
			
			
				Through bright and dark and bright
				Returns of day and night
				I bid the swift year speed and change and give
				His breath of life to make the next year live
				With sunnier suns for us
				A life more prosperous,
				And laugh with flowers more fragrant, that shall see
				A merrier March for me,
				A rosier-girdled race of night with day,
				A goodlier April and a tenderer May.
			
			
				For him the inverted year
				Shall mark our seasons here
				With alien alternation, and revive
				This withered winter, slaying the spring alive
				With darts more sharply drawn
				As nearer draws the dawn
				In heaven transfigured over earth transformed
				And with our winters warmed
				And wasted with our summers, till the beams
				Rise on his face that rose on Dante's dreams.
			
			
			
				Till fourfold morning rise
				Of starshine on his eyes,
				Dawn of the spheres that brand steep heaven across
				At height of night with semblance of a cross
				Whose grace and ghostly glory
				Poured heaven on purgatory,
				Seeing with their flamelets risen all heaven grow glad
				For love thereof it had
				And lovely joy of loving; so may these
				Make bright with welcome now their southern seas.
			
			
				O happy stars, whose mirth
				The saddest soul on earth
				That ever soared and sang found strong to bless,
				Lightening his life's harsh load of heaviness
				With comfort sown like seed
				In dream though not in deed
				On sprinkled wastes of darkling thought divine,
				Let all your lights now shine
				With all as glorious gladness on his eyes
				For whom indeed and not in dream they rise.
			
			
				As those great twins of air
				Hailed once with oldworld prayer
				Of all folk alway faring forth by sea,
				So now may these for grace and guidance be,
				To guard his sail and bring
				Again to brighten spring
				The face we look for and the hand we lack
				Still, till they light him back,
				As welcome as to first discovering eyes
				Their light rose ever, soon on his to rise.
			
			
			
				As parting now he goes
				From snow-time back to snows,
				So back to spring from summer may next year
				Restore him, and our hearts receive him here,
				The best good gift that spring
				Had ever grace to bring
				At fortune's happiest hour of star-blest birth
				Back to love's homebright earth,
				To eyes with eyes that commune, hand with hand,
				And the old warm bosom of all our mother-land.
			
			
				Earth and sea-wind and sea
				And stars and sunlight be
				Alike all prosperous for him, and all hours
				Have all one heart, and all that heart as ours.
				All things as good as strange
				Crown all the seasons' change
				With changing flower and compensating fruit
				From one year's ripening root;
				Till next year bring us, roused at spring's recall,
				A heartier flower and goodlier fruit than all.
