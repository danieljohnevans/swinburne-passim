                Far beyond the sunrise and the sunset rises
                Heaven, with worlds on worlds that lighten and respond:
                Thought can see not thence the goal of hope's surmises
                Far beyond.
            
            
                Night and day have made an everlasting bond
                Each with each to hide in yet more deep disguises
                Truth, till souls of men that thirst for truth despond.
            
            
                All that man in pride of spirit slights or prizes,
                All the dreams that make him fearful, fain, or fond,
                Fade at forethought's touch of life's unknown surprises
                Far beyond.
