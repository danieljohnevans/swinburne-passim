                				Unreconciled by life's fleet years, that fled
                				With changeful clang of pinions wide and wild,
                				Though two great spirits had lived, and hence had sped
                				Unreconciled;
                			
                			
                				Though time and change, harsh time's imperious child,
                				That wed strange hands together, might not wed
                				High hearts by hope's misprision once beguiled;
                			
                			
                				Faith, by the light from either's memory shed,
                				Sees, radiant as their ends were undefiled,
                				One goal for eachâ€”not twain among the dead
                				Unreconciled.
