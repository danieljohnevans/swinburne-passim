				There were four loves that one by one,
				Following the seasons and the sun,
				Passed over without tears, and fell
				Away without farewell.
			
			
				The first was made of gold and tears,
				The next of aspen-leaves and fears,
				The third of rose-boughs and rose-roots,
				The last love of strange fruits.
			
			
				These were the four loves faded. Hold
				Some minutes fast the time of gold
				When our lips each way clung and clove
				To a face full of love.
			
			
				The tears inside our eyelids met,
				Wrung forth with kissing, and wept wet
				The faces cleaving each to each
				Where the blood served for speech.
			
			
				The second, with low patient brows
				Bound under aspen-coloured boughs
				And eyes made strong and grave with sleep
				And yet too weak to weep —
			
			
			
				The third, with eager mouth at ease
				Fed from late autumn honey, lees
				Of scarce gold left in latter cells
				With scattered flower-smells —
			
			
				Hair sprinkled over with spoilt sweet
				Of ruined roses, wrists and feet
				Slight-swathed, as grassy-girdled sheaves
				Hold in stray poppy-leaves —
			
			
				The fourth, with lips whereon has bled
				Some great pale fruit’s slow colour, shed
				From the rank bitter husk whence drips
				Faint blood between her lips —
			
			
				Made of the heat of whole great Junes
				Burning the blue dark round their moons
				(Each like a mown red marigold)
				So hard the flame keeps hold —
			
			
				These are burnt thoroughly away.
				Only the first holds out a day
				Beyond these latter loves that were
				Made of mere heat and air.
			
			
				And now the time is winterly
				The first love fades too: none will see,
				When April warms the world anew,
				The place wherein love grew.
