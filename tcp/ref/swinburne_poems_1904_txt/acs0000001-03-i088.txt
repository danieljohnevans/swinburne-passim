                O weary fa' the east wind,
                And weary fa' the west:
                And gin I were under the wan waves wide
                I wot weel wad I rest.
            
            
                O weary fa' the north wind,
                And weary fa' the south:
                The sea went ower my good lord's head
                Or ever he kissed my mouth.
            
            
                Weary fa' the windward rocks,
                And weary fa' the lee:
                They might hae sunken sevenscore ships,
                And let my love's gang free.
            
            
                And weary fa' ye, mariners a',
                And weary fa' the sea:
                It might hae taken an hundred men,
                And let my ae love be.
