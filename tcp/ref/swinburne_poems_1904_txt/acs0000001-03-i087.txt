			O daughter , why do ye laugh and weep,
		
		One with another?

		Mother, my mother.
	
	
		Too long have your tears dripped down like dew,
		One with another.
		For a knight that my sire and my brethren slew,
		Mother, my mother.
	
	
		Let past things perish and dead griefs lie,
		One with another.
		O fain would I weep not, and fain would I die,
		Mother, my mother.

		One with another,
		Wedded in black and buried in white,
		Mother, my mother.
	
	
		The world's bliss and the world's teen,
		One with another,
		It's red for white and it's black for green,

		The world's will and the world's way,
		One with another,
		It's sighing for night and crying for day,
		Mother, my mother.
	
	
		The world's good and the world's worth,

		When she came out at the kirkyard gate,
		(One with another)
		The bridegroom's mother was there in wait.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		O mother, where is my great green bed,
		(One with another)
		Silk at the foot and gold at the head,
		Mother, my mother?
	
    
	
		Yea, it is ready, the silk and the gold,
		One with another.
		But line it well that I lie not cold,
		Mother, my mother.
	
	
		She laid her cheek to the velvet and vair,
		One with another;
		She laid her arms up under her hair.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		Her gold hair fell through her arms fu' low,
		One with another:
		Lord God, bring me out of woe!
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		Her gold hair fell in the gay reeds green,
		One with another:
		Lord God, bring me out of teen!
		(Mother, my mother.)
	


    * * * * * *
	
		O mother, where is my lady gone?
		(One with another.)
		In the bride-chamber she makes sore moan:
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		Her hair falls over the velvet and vair,
		(One with another)
		Her great soft tears fall over her hair.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		When he came into the bride's chamber,
		(One with another)
		Her hands were like pale yellow amber.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
    
	
		Her tears made specks in the velvet and vair,
		(One with another)
		The seeds of the reeds made specks in her hair.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		He kissed her under the gold on her head;
		(One with another)
		The lids of her eyes were like cold lead.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		He kissed her under the fall of her chin;
		(One with another)
		There was right little blood therein.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		He kissed her under her shoulder sweet;
		(One with another)
		Her throat was weak, with little heat.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		He kissed her down by her breast-flowers red,
		One with another;
		They were like river-flowers dead.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		What ails you now o' your weeping, wife?
		(One with another.)
		It ails me sair o' my very life.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		What ails you now o' your weary ways?
		(One with another.)
		It ails me sair o' my long life-days.
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
    
	
		Nay, ye are young, ye are over fair.
		(One with another.)
		Though I be young, what needs ye care?
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		Nay, ye are fair, ye are over sweet.
		(One with another.)
		Though I be fair, what needs ye greet?
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		Nay, ye are mine while I hold my life.
		(One with another.)
		O fool, will ye marry the worm for a wife?
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		Nay, ye are mine while I have my breath.
		(One with another.)
		O fool, will ye marry the dust of death?
		(Mother, my mother.)
	
	
		Yea, ye are mine, we are handfast wed,
		One with another.
		Nay, I am no man's; nay, I am dead,
		Mother, my mother.
