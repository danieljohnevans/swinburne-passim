				Under green apple-boughs
				That never a storm will rouse,
				My lady hath her house
				Between two bowers;
				In either of the twain
				Red roses full of rain;
				She hath for bondwomen
				All kind of flowers.
			
			
				She hath no handmaid fair
				To draw her curled gold hair
				Through rings of gold that bear
				Her whole hair’s weight;
				She hath no maids to stand
				Gold-clothed on either hand;
				In all the great green land
				None is so great.
			
			
				She hath no more to wear
				But one white hood of vair
				Drawn over eyes and hair,
				Wrought with strange gold,
				Made for some great queen’s head,
				Some fair great queen since dead;
				And one strait gown of red
				Against the cold.
			
			
			
				Beneath her eyelids deep
				Love lying seems asleep,
				Love, swift to wake, to weep,
				To laugh, to gaze;
				Her breasts are like white birds,
				And all her gracious words
				As water-grass to herds
				In the June-days.
			
			
				To her all dews that fall
				And rains are musical;
				Her flowers are fed from all,
				Her joy from these;
				In the deep-feathered firs
				Their gift of joy is hers,
				In the least breath that stirs
				Across the trees.
			
			
				She grows with greenest leaves,
				Ripens with reddest sheaves,
				Forgets, remembers, grieves,
				And is not sad;
				The quiet lands and skies
				Leave light upon her eyes;
				None knows her, weak or wise,
				Or tired or glad.
			
			
				None knows, none understands,
				What flowers are like her hands;
				Though you should search all lands
				Wherein time grows,
				What snows are like her feet,
				Though his eyes burn with heat
				Through gazing on my sweet,
				Yet no man knows.
			
			
			
				Only this thing is said;
				That white and gold and red,
				God’s three chief words, man’s bread
				And oil and wine,
				Were given her for dowers,
				And kingdom of all hours,
				And grace of goodly flowers
				And various vine.
			
			
				This is my lady’s praise:
				God after many days
				Wrought her in unknown ways,
				In sunset lands;
				This was my lady’s birth;
				God gave her might and mirth
				And laid his whole sweet earth
				Between her hands.
			
			
				Under deep apple-boughs
				My lady hath her house;
				She wears upon her brows
				The flower thereof;
				All saying but what God saith
				To her is as vain breath;
				She is more strong than death,
				Being strong as love.
