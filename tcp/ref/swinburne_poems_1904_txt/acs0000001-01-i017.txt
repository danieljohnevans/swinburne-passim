                                                  For the painting of faces
                                                  And the sundering of trust,

                                                  And a curse thy bride;
                                                  Thou shalt put her away, and another
                                                  Shall lie by thy side.
                                                
                                                
                                                  Thou shalt neither rise up by day
                                                  Nor lie down by night;
                                                  Would God it were dark! thou shalt say;
                                                  Would God it were light!
                                                            
                                                  And the sight of thine eyes shall be made
                                                  As the burning of fire;
                                                  And thy soul shall be sorely afraid
                                                  For thy soul’s desire.
                                                
                                                
                                                  Ye whom your lords loved well,
                                                  Putting silver and gold on you,
                                                  The inevitable hell
                                                  Shall surely take hold on you;
                                                  Your gold shall be for a token,
                                                  Your staff for a rod;
                                                  With the breaking of bands ye are broken,
                                                  Saith the Lord God.
                                                
                                    
                                    
                                                Tenth Antiphone
                                                
                                                  In our sorrow we said to the night,
                                                  Fall down and cover us;
                                                  To the darkness at left and at right,
                                                  Be thou shed over us;
                                                  We had breaking of spirit to mother
                                                  And cursing to bride;
                                                  And one was slain, and another
                                                  Stood up at our side.
                                                
                                                
                                                  We could not arise by day,
                                                  Nor lie down by night;
                                                  Thy sword was sharp in our way,
                                                  Thy word in our sight;
                                                  The delight of our eyelids was made
                                                  As the burning of fire;
                                                  And our souls became sorely afraid
                                                  For our soul’s desire.
                                                
                                                
                                                
                                                  We whom the world loved well,
                                                  Laying silver and gold on us,
                                                  The kingdom of death and of hell
                                                  Riseth up to take hold on us;
                                                  Our gold is turned to a token,
                                                  Our staff to a rod;
                                                  Yet shalt thou bind them up that were broken,
                                                  O Lord our God.
