                Many waters cannot quench love,
                Neither can the floods drown it.
                Who shall snare or slay the white dove
                Faith, whose very dreams crown it,
                Gird it round with grace and peace, deep,
                Warm, and pure, and soft as sweet sleep?
                Many waters cannot quench love,
                Neither can the floods drown it.
            
            
                Set me as a seal upon thine heart,
                As a seal upon thine arm.
                How should we behold the days depart
                And the nights resign their charm?
                Love is as the soul: though hate and fear
                Waste and overthrow, they strike not here.
                Set me as a seal upon thine heart,
                As a seal upon thine arm.
