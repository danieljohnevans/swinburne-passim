                Theleme is afar on the waters, adrift and afar,
                Afar and afloat on the waters that flicker and gleam,
                And we feel but her fragrance and see but the shadows that mar
                Theleme.
            
            
                In the sun-coloured mists of the sunrise and sunset that steam
                As incense from urns of the twilight, her portals ajar
                Let pass as a shadow the light of the sound of a dream.
            
            
                But the laughter that rings from her cloisters that know not a bar
                So kindles delight in desire that the souls in us deem
                He erred not, the seer who discerned on the seas as a star
                Theleme.
