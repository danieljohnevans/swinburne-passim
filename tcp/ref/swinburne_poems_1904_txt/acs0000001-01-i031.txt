                Sweet for a little even to fear, and sweet,
                O love, to lay down fear at love’s fair feet;
                Shall not some fiery memory of his breath
                Lie sweet on lips that touch the lips of death?
                Yet leave me not; yet, if thou wilt, be free;
                Love me no more, but love my love of thee.
                Love where thou wilt, and live thy life; and I,
                One thing I can, and one love cannot—die.
                Pass from me; yet thine arms, thine eyes, thine hair,
                Feed my desire and deaden my despair.
                Yet once more ere time change us, ere my cheek
                Whiten, ere hope be dumb or sorrow speak,
                Yet once more ere thou hate me, one full kiss;
                Keep other hours for others, save me this.
                Yea, and I will not (if it please thee) weep,
                Lest thou be sad; I will but sigh, and sleep.
                Sweet, does death hurt? thou canst not do me wrong:
                I shall not lack thee, as I loved thee, long.
                Hast thou not given me above all that live
                Joy, and a little sorrow shalt not give?
                What even though fairer fingers of strange girls
                Pass nestling through thy beautiful boy’s curls
                As mine did, or those curled lithe lips of thine
                Meet theirs as these, all theirs come after mine;
                
                And though I were not, though I be not, best,
                I have loved and love thee more than all the rest.
                O love, O lover, loose or hold me fast,
                I had thee first, whoever have thee last;
                Fairer or not, what need I know, what care?
                To thy fair bud my blossom once seemed fair.
                Why am I fair at all before thee, why
                At all desired? seeing thou art fair, not I.
                I shall be glad of thee, O fairest head,
                Alive, alone, without thee, with thee, dead;
                I shall remember while the light lives yet,
                And in the night-time I shall not forget.
                Though (as thou wilt) thou leave me ere life leave,
                I will not, for thy love I will not, grieve;
                Not as they use who love not more than I,
                Who love not as I love thee though I die;
                And though thy lips, once mine, be oftener prest
                To many another brow and balmier breast,
                And sweeter arms, or sweeter to thy mind,
                Lull thee or lure, more fond thou wilt not find.
