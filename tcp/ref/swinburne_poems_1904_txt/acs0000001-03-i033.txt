                What is gold worth, say,
                Worth for work or play,
                Worth to keep or pay,
                Hide or throw away,
                Hope about or fear?
                What is love worth, pray?
                Worth a tear?
            
            
                Golden on the mould
                Lie the dead leaves rolled
                Of the wet woods old,
                Yellow leaves and cold,
                Woods without a dove;
                Gold is worth but gold;
                Love's worth love.
