                Kind, wise, and true as truth's own heart,
                A soul that here
                Chose and held fast the better part
                And cast out fear,
            
            
                Has left us ere we dreamed of death
                For life so strong,
                Clear as the sundawn's light and breath,
                And sweet as song.
            
            
                We see no more what here awhile
                Shed light on men:
                Has Landor seen that brave bright smile
                Alive again?
            
            
                If death and life and love be one
                And hope no lie
                And night no stronger than the sun,
                These cannot die.
            
            
                The father-spirit whence her soul
                Took strength, and gave
                Back love, is perfect yet and whole,
                As hope might crave.
            
            
            
                His word is living light and fire:
                And hers shall live
                By grace of all good gifts the sire
                Gave power to give.
            
            
                The sire and daughter, twain and one
                In quest and goal,
                Stand face to face beyond the sun,
                And soul to soul.
            
            
                Not we, who loved them well, may dream
                What joy sublime
                Is theirs, if dawn through darkness gleam,
                And life through time.
            
            
                Time seems but here the mask of death,
                That falls and shows
                A void where hope may draw not breath:
                Night only knows.
            
            
                Love knows not: all that love may keep
                Glad memory gives:
                The spirit of the days that sleep
                Still wakes and lives.
            
            
                But not the spirit's self, though song
                Would lend it speech,
                May touch the goal that hope might long
                In vain to reach.
            
            
                How dear that high true heart, how sweet
                Those keen kind eyes,
                Love knows, who knows how fiery fleet
                Is life that flies.
            
            
            
                If life there be that flies not, fair
                The life must be
                That thrills her sovereign spirit there
                And sets it free.
