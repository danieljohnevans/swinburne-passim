                A life more bright than the sun's face, bowed
                Through stress of season and coil of cloud,
                Sets: and the sorrow that casts out fear
                Scarce deems him dead in his chill still shroud,
            
            
                Dead on the breast of the dying year,
                Poet and painter and friend, thrice dear
                For love of the suns long set, for love
                Of song that sets not with sunset here,
            
            
                For love of the fervent heart, above
                Their sense who saw not the swift light move
                That filled with sense of the loud sun's lyre
                The thoughts that passion was fain to prove
            
            
                In fervent labour of high desire
                And faith that leapt from its own quenched pyre
                Alive and strong as the sun, and caught
                From darkness light, and from twilight fire.
            
            
                Passion, deep as the depths unsought
                Whence faith's own hope may redeem us nought,
                Filled full with ardour of pain sublime
                His mourning song and his mounting thought.
            
            
            
                Elate with sense of a sterner time,
                His hand's flight clomb as a bird's might climb
                Calvary: dark in the darkling air
                That shrank for fear of the crowning crime,
            
            
                Three crosses rose on the hillside bare,
                Shown scarce by grace of the lightning's glare
                That clove the veil of the temple through
                And smote the priests on the threshold there.
            
            
                The soul that saw it, the hand that drew,
                Whence light as thought's or as faith's glance flew,
                And stung to life the sepulchral past,
                And bade the stars of it burn anew,
            
            
                Held no less than the dead world fast
                The light live shadows about them cast,
                The likeness living of dawn and night,
                The days that pass and the dreams that last.
            
            
                Thought, clothed round with sorrow as light,
                Dark as a cloud that the moon turns bright,
                Moved, as a wind on the striving sea,
                That yearns and quickens and flags in flight,
            
            
                Through forms of colour and song that he
                Who fain would have set its wide wings free
                Cast round it, clothing or chaining hope
                With lights that last not and shades that flee.
            
            
                Scarce in song could his soul find scope,
                Scarce the strength of his hand might ope
                Art's inmost gate of her sovereign shrine,
                To cope with heaven as a man may cope.
            
            
            
                But high as the hope of a man may shine
                The faith, the fervour, the life divine
                That thrills our life and transfigures, rose
                And shone resurgent, a sunbright sign,
            
            
                Through shapes whereunder the strong soul glows
                And fills them full as a sunlit rose
                With sense and fervour of life, whose light
                The fool's eye knows not, the man's eye knows.
            
            
                None that can read or divine aright
                The scriptures writ of the soul may slight
                The strife of a strenuous soul to show
                More than the craft of the hand may write.
            
            
                None may slight it, and none may know
                How high the flames that aspire and glow
                From heart and spirit and soul may climb
                And triumph; higher than the souls lie low
            
            
                Whose hearing hears not the livelong rhyme,
                Whose eyesight sees not the light sublime,
                That shines, that sounds, that ascends and lives
                Unquenched of change, unobscured of time.
            
            
                A long life's length, as a man's life gives
                Space for the spirit that soars and strives
                To strive and soar, has the soul shone through
                That heeds not whither the world's wind drives
            
            
                Now that the days and the ways it knew
                Are strange, are dead as the dawn's grey dew
                At high midnoon of the mounting day
                That mocks the might of the dawn it slew.
            
            
            
                Yet haply may not—and haply may—
                No sense abide of the dead sun's ray
                Wherein the soul that outsoars us now
                Rejoiced with ours in its radiant sway.
            
            
                Hope may hover, and doubt may bow,
                Dreaming. Haply—they dream not how—
                Not life but death may indeed be dead
                When silence darkens the dead man's brow.
            
            
                Hope, whose name is remembrance, fed
                With love that lightens from seasons fled,
                Dreams, and craves not indeed to know,
                That death and life are as souls that wed.
            
            
                But change that falls on the heart like snow
                Can chill not memory nor hope, that show
                The soul, the spirit, the heart and head,
                Alive above us who strive below.
