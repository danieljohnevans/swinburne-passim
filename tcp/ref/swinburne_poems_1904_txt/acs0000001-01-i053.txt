			(From Boccaccio)
			
				I will that if I say a heavy thing
				Your tongues forgive me; seeing ye know that spring
				Has flecks and fits of pain to keep her sweet,
				And walks somewhile with winter-bitten feet.
				Moreover it sounds often well to let
				One string, when ye play music, keep at fret
				The whole song through; one petal that is dead
				Confirms the roses, be they white or red;
				Dead sorrow is not sorrowful to hear
				As the thick noise that breaks mid weeping were;
				The sick sound aching in a lifted throat
				Turns to sharp silver of a perfect note;
				And though the rain falls often, and with rain
				Late autumn falls on the old red leaves like pain,
				I deem that God is not disquieted.
				Also while men are fed with wine and bread,
				They shall be fed with sorrow at his hand.
			
			
				There grew a rose-garden in Florence land
				More fair than many; all red summers through
				The leaves smelt sweet and sharp of rain, and blew
				Sideways with tender wind; and therein fell
				Sweet sound wherewith the green waxed audible,
				
				As a bird’s will to sing disturbed his throat
				And set the sharp wings forward like a boat
				Pushed through soft water, moving his brown side
				Smooth-shapen as a maid’s, and shook with pride
				His deep warm bosom, till the heavy sun’s
				Set face of heat stopped all the songs at once.
				The ways were clean to walk and delicate;
				And when the windy white of March grew late,
				Before the trees took heart to face the sun
				With ravelled raiment of lean winter on,
				The roots were thick and hot with hollow grass.
			
			
				Some roods away a lordly house there was,
				Cool with broad courts and latticed passage wet
				From rush-flowers and lilies ripe to set,
				Sown close among the strewings of the floor;
				And either wall of the slow corridor
				Was dim with deep device of gracious things;
				Some angel’s steady mouth and weight of wings
				Shut to the side; or Peter with straight stole
				And beard cut black against the aureole
				That spanned his head from nape to crown; thereby
				Mary’s gold hair, thick to the girdle-tie
				Wherein was bound a child with tender feet;
				Or the broad cross with blood nigh brown on it.
			
			
				Within this house a righteous lord abode,
				Ser Averardo; patient of his mood,
				And just of judgment; and to child he had
				A maid so sweet that her mere sight made glad
				Men sorrowing, and unbound the brows of hate;
				And where she came, the lips that pain made strait
				Waxed warm and wide, and from untender grew
				Tender as those that sleep brings patience to.
				Such long locks had she, that with knee to chin
				She might have wrapped and warmed her feet therein.
				
				Right seldom fell her face on weeping wise;
				Gold hair she had, and golden-coloured eyes,
				Filled with clear light and fire and large repose
				Like a fair hound’s; no man there is but knows
				Her face was white, and thereto she was tall;
				In no wise lacked there any praise at all
				To her most perfect and pure maidenhood;
				No sin I think there was in all her blood.
			
			
				She, where a gold grate shut the roses in,
				Dwelt daily through deep summer weeks, through green
				Flushed hours of rain upon the leaves; and there
				Love made him room and space to worship her
				With tender worship of bowed knees, and wrought
				Such pleasure as the pained sense palates not
				For weariness, but at one taste undoes
				The heart of its strong sweet, is ravenous
				Of all the hidden honey; words and sense
				Fail through the tune’s imperious prevalence.
			
			
				In a poor house this lover kept apart,
				Long communing with patience next his heart
				If love of his might move that face at all,
				Tuned evenwise with colours musical;
				Then after length of days he said thus: “Love,
				For love’s own sake and for the love thereof
				Let no harsh words untune your gracious mood;
				For good it were, if anything be good,
				To comfort me in this pain’s plague of mine;
				Seeing thus, how neither sleep nor bread nor wine
				Seems pleasant to me, yea no thing that is
				Seems pleasant to me; only I know this,
				Love’s ways are sharp for palms of piteous feet
				To travel, but the end of such is sweet:
				
				Now do with me as seemeth you the best.”
				She mused a little, as one holds his guest
				By the hand musing, with her face borne down:
				Then said: “Yea, though such bitter seed be sown,
				Have no more care of all that you have said;
				Since if there is no sleep will bind your head,
				Lo, I am fain to help you certainly;
				Christ knoweth, sir, if I would have you die;
				There is no pleasure when a man is dead.”
				Thereat he kissed her hands and yellow head
				And clipped her fair long body many times;
				I have no wit to shape in written rhymes
				A scanted tithe of this great joy they had.
			
			
				They were too near love’s secret to be glad;
				As whoso deems the core will surely melt
				From the warm fruit his lips caress, hath felt
				Some bitter kernel where the teeth shut hard:
				Or as sweet music sharpens afterward,
				Being half disrelished both for sharp and sweet;
				As sea-water, having killed over-heat
				In a man’s body, chills it with faint ache;
				So their sense, burdened only for love’s sake,
				Failed for pure love; yet so time served their wit,
				They saved each day some gold reserves of it,
				Being wiser in love’s riddle than such be
				Whom fragments feed with his chance charity.
				All things felt sweet were felt sweet overmuch;
				The rose-thorn’s prickle dangerous to touch,
				And flecks of fire in the thin leaf-shadows;
				Too keen the breathèd honey of the rose,
				Its red too harsh a weight on feasted eyes;
				They were so far gone in love’s histories,
				Beyond all shape and colour and mere breath,
				Where pleasure has for kinsfolk sleep and death,
				
				And strength of soul and body waxen blind
				For weariness, and flesh entoiled with mind,
				When the keen edge of sense foretasteth sin.
			
			
				Even this green place the summer caught them in
				Seemed half deflowered and sick with beaten leaves
				In their strayed eyes; these gold flower-fumèd eves
				Burnt out to make the sun’s love-offering,
				The midnoon’s prayer, the rose’s thanksgiving,
				The trees’ weight burdening the strengthless air,
				The shape of her stilled eyes, her coloured hair,
				Her body’s balance from the moving feet —
				All this, found fair, lacked yet one grain of sweet
				It had some warm weeks back: so perisheth
				On May’s new lip the tender April breath:
				So those same walks the wind sowed lilies in
				All April through, and all their latter kin
				Of languid leaves whereon the Autumn blows —
				The dead red raiment of the last year’s rose —
				The last year’s laurel, and the last year’s love,
				Fade, and grow things that death grows weary of.
			
			
				What man will gather in red summer-time
				The fruit of some obscure and hoary rhyme
				Heard last midwinter, taste the heart in it,
				Mould the smooth semitones afresh, refit
				The fair limbs ruined, flush the dead blood through
				With colour, make all broken beauties new
				For love’s new lesson — shall not such find pain
				When the marred music labouring in his brain
				Frets him with sweet sharp fragments, and lets slip
				One word that might leave satisfied his lip —
				One touch that might put fire in all the chords?
				This was her pain: to miss from all sweet words
				Some taste of sound, diverse and delicate —
				Some speech the old love found out to compensate
				
				For seasons of shut lips and drowsiness —
				Some grace, some word the old love found out to bless
				Passionless months and undelighted weeks.
				The flowers had lost their summer-scented cheeks,
				Their lips were no more sweet than daily breath:
				The year was plagued with instances of death.
			
			
				So fell it, these were sitting in cool grass
				With leaves about, and many a bird there was
				Where the green shadow thickliest impleached
				Soft fruit and writhen spray and blossom bleached
				Dry in the sun or washed with rains to white:
				Her girdle was pure silk, the bosom bright
				With purple as purple water and gold wrought in.
				One branch had touched with dusk her lips and chin,
				Made violet of the throat, abashed with shade
				The breast’s bright plaited work: but nothing frayed
				The sun’s large kiss on the luxurious hair.
				Her beauty was new colour to the air
				And music to the silent many birds.
				Love was an-hungred for some perfect words
				To praise her with; but only her low name
				“Andrevuola” came thrice, and thrice put shame
				In her clear cheek, so fruitful with new red
				That for pure love straightway shame’s self was dead.
			
			
				Then with lids gathered as who late had wept
				She began saying: “I have so little slept
				My lids drowse now against the very sun;
				Yea, the brain aching with a dream begun
				Beats like a fitful blood; kiss but both brows,
				And you shall pluck my thoughts grown dangerous
				Almost away.” He said thus, kissing them:
				“O sole sweet thing that God is glad to name,
				My one gold gift, if dreams be sharp and sore
				Shall not the waking time increase much more
				
				With taste and sound, sweet eyesight or sweet scent?
				Has any heat too hard and insolent
				Burnt bare the tender married leaves, undone
				The maiden grass shut under from the sun?
				Where in this world is room enough for pain?”
			
			
				The feverish finger of love had touched again
				Her lips with happier blood; the pain lay meek
				In her fair face, nor altered lip nor cheek
				With pallor or with pulse; but in her mouth
				Love thirsted as a man wayfaring doth,
				Making it humble as weak hunger is.
				She lay close to him, bade do this and this,
				Say that, sing thus: then almost weeping-ripe
				Crouched, then laughed low. As one that fain would wipe
				The old record out of old things done and dead,
				She rose, she heaved her hands up, and waxed red
				For wilful heart and blameless fear of blame;
				Saying “Though my wits be weak, this is no shame
				For a poor maid whom love so punisheth
				With heats of hesitation and stopped breath
				That with my dreams I live yet heavily
				For pure sad heart and faith’s humility.
				Now be not wroth and I will show you this.
			
			
				“Methought our lips upon their second kiss
				Met in this place, and a fair day we had
				And fair soft leaves that waxed and were not sad
				With shaken rain or bitten through with drouth;
				When I, beholding ever how your mouth
				Waited for mine, the throat being fallen back,
				Saw crawl thereout a live thing flaked with black
				Specks of brute slime and leper-coloured scale,
				A devil’s hide with foul flame-writhen grail
				
				Fashioned where hell’s heat festers loathsomest;
				And that brief speech may ease me of the rest,
				Thus were you slain and eaten of the thing.
				My waked eyes felt the new day shuddering
				On their low lids, felt the whole east so beat,
				Pant with close pulse of such a plague-struck heat,
				As if the palpitating dawn drew breath
				For horror, breathing between life and death,
				Till the sun sprang blood-bright and violent.”
			
			
				So finishing, her soft strength wholly spent,
				She gazed each way, lest some brute-hoovèd thing,
				The timeless travail of hell’s childbearing,
				Should threat upon the sudden: whereat he,
				For relish of her tasted misery
				And tender little thornprick of her pain,
				Laughed with mere love. What lover among men
				But hath his sense fed sovereignly ’twixt whiles
				With tears and covered eyelids and sick smiles
				And soft disaster of a painèd face?
				What pain, established in so sweet a place,
				But the plucked leaf of it smells fragrantly?
				What colour burning man’s wide-open eye
				But may be pleasurably seen? what sense
				Keeps in its hot sharp extreme violence
				No savour of sweet things? The bereaved blood
				And emptied flesh in their most broken mood
				Fail not so wholly, famish not when thus
				Past honey keeps the starved lip covetous.
			
			
				Therefore this speech from a glad mouth began,
				Breathed in her tender hair and temples wan
				Like one prolonged kiss while the lips had breath.
				“Sleep, that abides in vassalage of death
				And in death’s service wears out half his age,
				Hath his dreams full of deadly vassalage,
				
				Shadow and sound of things ungracious;
				Fair shallow faces, hooded bloodless brows,
				And mouths past kissing; yea, myself have had
				As harsh a dream as holds your eyelids sad.
			
			
				“This dream I tell you came three nights ago;
				In full mid sleep I took a whim to know
				How sweet things might be; so I turned and thought;
				But save my dream all sweet availed me not.
				First came a smell of pounded spice and scent
				Such as God ripens in some continent
			    Of utmost amber in the Syrian sea;
				And breaths as though some costly rose could be
				Spoiled slowly, wasted by some bitter fire
				To burn the sweet out leaf by leaf, and tire
				The flower’s poor heart with heat and waste, to make
				Strong magic for some perfumed woman’s sake.
				Then a cool naked sense beneath my feet
				Of bud and blossom; and sound of veins that beat
				As if a lute should play of its own heart
				And fearfully, not smitten of either part;
				And all my blood it filled with sharp and sweet
				As gold swoln grain fills out the huskèd wheat;
				So I rose naked from the bed, and stood
				Counting the mobile measure in my blood
				Some pleasant while, and through each limb there came
				Swift little pleasures pungent as a flame,
				Felt in the thrilling flesh and veins as much
				As the outer curls that feel the comb’s first touch
				Thrill to the roots and shiver as from fire;
				And blind between my dream and my desire
				I seemed to stand and held my spirit still
				Lest this should cease. A child whose fingers spill
				
				Honey from cells forgotten of the bee
				Is less afraid to stir the hive and see
				Some wasp’s bright back inside, than I to feel
				Some finger-touch disturb the flesh like steel.
				I prayed thus; Let me catch a secret here
				So sweet, it sharpens the sweet taste of fear
				And takes the mouth with edge of wine; I would
				Have here some colour and smooth shape as good
				As those in heaven whom the chief garden hides
				With low grape-blossom veiling their white sides
				And lesser tendrils that so bind and blind
				Their eyes and feet, that if one come behind
				To touch their hair they see not, neither fly;
				This would I see in heaven and not die.
				So praying, I had nigh cried out and knelt,
				So wholly my prayer filled me: till I felt
				In the dumb night’s warm weight of glowing gloom
				Somewhat that altered all my sleeping-room,
				And made it like a green low place wherein
				Maids mix to bathe: one sets her small warm chin
				Against a ripple, that the angry pearl
				May flow like flame about her: the next curl
				Dips in some eddy coloured of the sun
				To wash the dust well out; another one
				Holds a straight ankle in her hand and swings
				With lavish body sidelong, so that rings
				Of sweet fierce water, swollen and splendid, fail
				All round her fine and floated body pale,
				Swayed flower-fashion, and her balanced side
				Swerved edgeways lets the weight of water slide,
				As taken in some underflow of sea
				Swerves the banked gold of sea-flowers; but she
				Pulls down some branch to keep her perfect head
				Clear of the river: even from wall to bed,
				
				I tell you, was my room transfigured so.
				Sweet, green and warm it was, nor could one know
				If there were walls or leaves, or if there was
				No bed’s green curtain, but mere gentle grass.
				There were set also hard against the feet
				Gold plates with honey and green grapes to eat,
				With the cool water’s noise to hear in rhymes:
				And a wind warmed me full of furze and limes
				And all hot sweets the heavy summer fills
				To the round brim of smooth cup-shapen hills.
				Next the grave walking of a woman’s feet
				Made my veins hesitate, and gracious heat
				Made thick the lids and leaden on mine eyes:
				And I thought ever, surely it were wise
				Not yet to see her: this may last (who knows?)
				Five minutes; the poor rose is twice a rose
				Because it turns a face to her, the wind
				Sings that way; hath this woman ever sinned,
				I wonder? as a boy with apple-rind,
				I played with pleasures, made them to my mind,
				Changed each ere tasting. When she came indeed,
				First her hair touched me, then I grew to feed
				On the sense of her hand; her mouth at last
				Touched me between the cheek and lip and past
				Over my face with kisses here and there
				Sown in and out across the eyes and hair.
				Still I said nothing; till she set her face
				More close and harder on the kissing-place,
				And her mouth caught like a snake’s mouth, and stung
				So faint and tenderly, the fang scarce clung
				More than a bird’s foot: yet a wound it grew,
				A great one, let this red mark witness you
				
				Under the left breast; and the stroke thereof
				So clove my sense that I woke out of love
				And knew not what this dream was nor had wit;
				But now God knows if I have skill of it.”
			
			
				Hereat she laid one palm against her lips
				To stop their trembling; as when water slips
				Out of a beak-mouthed vessel with faint noise
				And chuckles in the narrowed throat and cloys
				The carven rims with murmuring, so came
				Words in her lips with no word right of them,
				A beaten speech thick and disconsolate,
				Till his smile ceasing waxed compassionate
				Of her sore fear that grew from anything —
				The sound of the strong summer thickening
				In heated leaves of the smooth apple-trees:
				The day’s breath felt about the ash-branches,
				And noises of the noon whose weight still grew
				On the hot heavy-headed flowers, and drew
				Their red mouths open till the rose-heart ached;
				For eastward all the crowding rose was slaked
				And soothed with shade: but westward all its growth
				Seemed to breathe hard with heat as a man doth
				Who feels his temples newly feverous.
				And even with such motion in her brows
				As that man hath in whom sick days begin,
				She turned her throat and spake, her voice being thin
				As a sick man’s, sudden and tremulous;
				“Sweet, if this end be come indeed on us,
				Let us love more;” and held his mouth with hers.
				As the first sound of flooded hill-waters
				Is heard by people of the meadow-grass,
				Or ever a wandering waif of ruin pass
				With whirling stones and foam of the brown stream
				Flaked with fierce yellow: so beholding him
				
				She felt before tears came her eyelids wet,
				Saw the face deadly thin where life was yet,
				Heard his throat’s harsh last moan before it clomb:
				And he, with close mouth passionate and dumb,
				Burned at her lips: so lay they without speech,
				Each grasping other, and the eyes of each
				Fed in the other’s face: till suddenly
				He cried out with a little broken cry
				This word, “O help me, sweet, I am but dead.”
				And even so saying, the colour of fair red
				Was gone out of his face, and his blood’s beat
				Fell, and stark death made sharp his upward feet
				And pointed hands: and without moan he died.
				Pain smote her sudden in the brows and side,
				Strained her lips open and made burn her eyes:
				For the pure sharpness of her miseries
				She had no heart’s pain, but mere body’s wrack;
				But at the last her beaten blood drew back
				Slowly upon her face, and her stunned brows
				Suddenly grown aware and piteous
				Gathered themselves, her eyes shone, her hard breath
				Came as though one nigh dead came back from death;
				Her lips throbbed, and life trembled through her hair.
			
			
				And in brief while she thought to bury there
				The dead man that her love might lie with him
				In a sweet bed under the rose-roots dim
				And soft earth round the branchèd apple-trees,
				Full of hushed heat and heavy with great ease,
				And no man entering divide him thence.
				Wherefore she bade one of her handmaidens
				To be her help to do upon this wise.
				And saying so the tears out of her eyes
				Fell without noise and comforted her heart:
				Yea, her great pain eased of the sorest part
				
				Began to soften in her sense of it.
				There under all the little branches sweet
				The place was shapen of his burial;
				They shed thereon no thing funereal,
				But coloured leaves of latter rose-blossom,
				Stems of soft grass, some withered red and some
				Fair and fresh-blooded; and spoil splendider
				Of marigold and great spent sunflower.
			
			
				And afterward she came back without word
				To her own house; two days went, and the third
				Went, and she showed her father of this thing.
				And for great grief of her soul’s travailing
				He gave consent she should endure in peace
				Till her life’s end; yea, till her time should cease,
				She should abide in fellowship of pain.
				And having lived a holy year or twain
				She died of pure waste heart and weariness.
				And for love’s honour in her love’s distress
				This word was written over her tomb’s head;
				“Here dead she lieth, for whose sake Love is dead.”
