                England, elect of time,
                By freedom sealed sublime,
                And constant as the sun that saw thy dawn
                Outshine upon the sea
                His own in heaven, to be
                A light that night nor day should see withdrawn,
                If song may speak not now thy praise,
                Fame writes it higher than song may soar or faith may gaze.
            
            
                Dark months on months beheld
                Hope thwarted, crossed, and quelled,
                And heard the heartless hounds of hatred bay
                Aloud against thee, glad
                As now their souls are sad
                Who see their hope in hatred pass away
                And wither into shame and fear
                And shudder down to darkness, loth to see or hear.
            
            
                Nought now they hear or see
                That speaks or shows not thee
                Triumphant; not as empires reared of yore,
                The imperial commonweal
                That bears thy sovereign seal
                
                And signs thine orient as thy natural shore
                Free, as no sons but thine may stand,
                Steers lifeward ever, guided of thy pilot hand.
            
            
                Fear, masked and veiled by fraud,
                Found shameful time to applaud
                Shame, and bow down thy banner towards the dust,
                And call on godly shame
                To desecrate thy name
                And bid false penitence abjure thy trust:
                Till England's heart took thought at last,
                And felt her future kindle from her fiery past.
            
            
                Then sprang the sunbright fire
                High as the sun, and higher
                Than strange men's eyes might watch it undismayed:
                But winds athwart it blew
                Storm, and the twilight grew
                Darkness awhile, an unenduring shade:
                And all base birds and beasts of night
                Saw no more England now to fear, no loathsome light.
            
            
                All knaves and slaves at heart
                Who, knowing thee what thou art,
                Abhor thee, seeing what none save here may see,
                Strong freedom, taintless truth,
                Supreme in ageless youth,
                Howled all their hate and hope aloud at thee
                While yet the wavering wind of strife
                Bore hard against her sail whose freight is hope and life.
            
            
            
                And now the quickening tide
                That brings back power and pride
                To faith and love whose ensign is thy name
                Bears down the recreant lie
                That doomed thy name to die,
                Sons, friends, and foes behold thy star the same
                As when it stood in heaven a sun
                And Europe saw no glory left her sky save one.
            
            
                And now, as then she saw,
                She sees with shamefast awe
                How all unlike all slaves and tyrants born
                Where bondmen champ the bit
                And anarchs foam and flit,
                And day mocks day, and year puts year to scorn,
                Our mother bore us, English men,
                Ashamed of shame and strong in mercy, now as then.
            
            
                We loosed not on these knaves
                Their scourge-tormented slaves:
                We held the hand that fain had risen to smite
                The torturer fast, and made
                Justice awhile afraid,
                And righteousness forego her ruthless right:
                We warred not even with these as they;
                We bade not them they preyed on make of them their prey.
            
            
                All murderous fraud that lurks
                In hearts where hell's craft works
                Fought, crawled, and slew in darkness: they that died
                Dreamed not of foes too base
                For scorn to grant them grace:
                
                Men wounded, women, children at their side,
                Had found what faith in fiends may live:
                And yet we gave not back what righteous doom would give.
            
            
                No false white flag that fawns
                On faith till murder dawns
                Blood-red from hell-black treason's heart of hate
                Left ever shame's foul brand
                Seared on an English hand:
                And yet our pride vouchsafes them grace too great
                For other pride to dream of: scorn
                Strikes retribution silent as the stars at morn.
            
            
                And now the living breath
                Whose life puts death to death,
                Freedom, whose name is England, stirs and thrills
                The burning darkness through
                Whence fraud and slavery grew,
                We scarce may mourn our dead whose fame fulfils
                The record where her foes have read
                That earth shall see none like her born ere earth be dead.
